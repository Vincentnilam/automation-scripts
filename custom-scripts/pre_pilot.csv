This completes the proof.","## Problem Restatement

Consider a \(99 \times 99\) board divided into unit squares.  
There are \(2500\) rectangles, each covering exactly 3 cells (so each rectangle is either a \(1 \times 3\) or a \(3 \times 1\) block).  
**Claim:** Prove that there must be two rectangles that share a common border of length at least 2.

---

## Solution

This is a **pigeonhole / density argument**.

### Step 1: Count how many cells are covered in total.

Each rectangle covers 3 cells:
\[
2500 \times 3 = 7500 \text{ cells}.
\]
The total number of cells on the board is:
\[
99 \times 99 = 9801.
\]
About \(76\%\) of the board’s area is occupied.

---

### Step 2: Subdivide the board into smaller subboards.

Divide the \(99 \times 99\) grid into non-overlapping \(3 \times 3\) blocks.  
Since \(99\) is divisible by 3:
\[
(99/3)^2 = 33^2 = 1089 \text{ blocks}.
\]

**Observation:**  
Each rectangle of size \(1 \times 3\) or \(3 \times 1\) fits **entirely** inside exactly one \(3 \times 3\) block (since its maximal extent is length 3).

---

### Step 3: Average number of rectangles per block.

\[
\frac{2500}{1089} \approx 2.3.
\]

By the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one block containing at least 3 rectangles.

Indeed:
\[
1089 \times 2 = 2178 < 2500.
\]
Even if every block contained only 2 rectangles, there would still be \(2500 - 2178 = 322\) rectangles left over.  
Therefore, at least \(322\) blocks must contain **at least 3 rectangles**.

---

### Step 4: Conclude existence of touching rectangles.

Within a single \(3 \times 3\) block:
- There are 9 cells.
- We place 3 rectangles, each covering 3 cells.
- In total, they cover \(9\) cells exactly.

So the block is **fully tiled** by these 3 rectangles.

**Key point:**
No matter how you arrange 3 trominoes to exactly fill a \(3 \times 3\) block, at least two of them must share a common border of length at least 2 (e.g., they must be adjacent along their long edges).

Therefore, **two rectangles necessarily share a border of length at least 2**.

---

## Conclusion

Because of the high density forcing complete tiling of some \(3 \times 3\) blocks, there must be two rectangles with a shared border of length at least 2.

**Observation:**

Even if every block contained only 2 rectangles, there would still be \(2500 - 2178 = 322\) rectangles left over.  
Therefore, at least \(322\) blocks must contain **at least 3 rectangles**.

Therefore, **two rectangles necessarily share a border of length at least 2**.

mem_cmc7jg74o00090wog9qs03lx6,2025-07-04 12:16:14.066,There is a square $ABCD$ and a square $AXYZ$ such that $Y$ lies on segment $BC$. What is the measure of $\angle ADZ$?,probID_Two_Squares_Sharing_A,"There are many different solutions to this problem, here are two possible ones:

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","**Answer:** $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$.

**Proof:** We start with the following claim:

**Claim**. The points $A$, $X$, $B$, $Y$ and $Z$ lie on a circle with diameter $AY$.

**Proof:** Note that $ABCD$ is a square, so $\angle ABY = 90^{\circ}$. Similarly, $\angle AXY = 90^{\circ} = \angle AZY = 90^{\circ}$ since $AXYZ$ is also a square. Since $\angle ABY = \angle AXY = \angle AZY = 90^{\circ}$, then points $A$, $X$, $B$, $Y$, and $Z$ lie on a circle with diameter $AY$, as desired.

Now, since $ZA = ZY$ (as these are sides of the square $AXYZ$), we have that $\overline{BZ}$ is the internal angle bisector of $\angle ABY$. This is because since the two segments are equal and $ABYZ$ is cyclic, then the arcs $AZ$ and $ZY$ on the circle (not containing point $B$) are equal, and thus $\angle ABZ = \angle YBZ$. However, their sum is $\angle ABY = 90^{\circ}$, so $\angle ABZ = \angle YBZ = 45^{\circ}$. 

To conclude, note that $\angle ABD = \angle CBD = 45^{\circ}$ in the square $ABCD$, so points $B$, $Z$, and $D$ are concurrent as $\angle ABZ = 45^{\circ} = \angle ABD$. To finish, we only need to compute that $\angle ADZ = \angle ADB = 45^{\circ}$, where we used that $Z$ lies on segment $BD$. This concludes the proof and we showed that $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as desired.",AB,"Pass, Pass, Pass","A, A, A","A, B, A",None,None,"{

mem_cmc7jg74o00090wog9qs03lx6,2025-07-04 12:23:13.371,There is a square $ABCD$ and a square $AXYZ$ such that $Y$ lies on segment $BC$. What is the measure of $\angle ADZ$?,probID_Two_Squares_Sharing_A,"There are many different solutions to this problem, here are two possible ones:

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","**Answer:** $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$.

**Step 1.** We start with the following claim.

**Claim 1.** The points $A$, $B$, $Y$ and $Z$ lie on a circle with diameter $AY$.

**Proof:** Note that $ABCD$ is a square, so $\angle ABY = 90^{\circ}$. Similarly, $\angle AZY = 90^{\circ}$ since $AXYZ$ is also a square. This shows that points $A$, $B$, $Y$, and $Z$ lie on a circle with diameter $AY$, as desired.

**Step 2.** We continue with a second claim.

**Claim 2.** $\angle ABZ = 45^{\circ}$.

**Proof:** Since $ZA = ZY$ (as these are sides of the square $AXYZ$), we have that $\overline{BZ}$ is the internal angle bisector of $\angle ABY$. This is because since the two segments are equal and $ABYZ$ is cyclic, then the arcs $AZ$ and $ZY$ on the circle (not containing point $B$) are equal, and thus $\angle ABZ = \angle YBZ$. However, their sum is $\angle ABY = 90^{\circ}$, so $\angle ABZ = \frac{1}{2}\cdot 90^{\circ} = 45^{\circ}$, as desired.

**Step 3.** We prove a third claim as well.

**Claim 3.** Point $Z$ lies on segment $BD$.

**Proof:** Note that $\angle ABD = \angle CBD = 45^{\circ}$ in the square $ABCD$, so points $B$, $Z$, and $D$ are concurrent as $\angle ABZ = 45^{\circ} = \angle ABD$ from **Claim 2**.

**Step 4**. To finish, we only need to compute that $\angle ADZ = \angle ADB = 45^{\circ}$, where we used that $Z$ lies on segment $BD$. This concludes the proof and we showed that $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as desired.",AA,"Pass, Pass, Pass","A, A, A","A, A, A",None,None,"{

mem_cmckk9n0h001k0wob2fwzbs7o,2025-07-04 12:25:27.736,There is a square $ABCD$ and a square $AXYZ$ such that $Y$ lies on segment $BC$. What is the measure of $\angle ADZ$?,probID_Two_Squares_Sharing_A,"There are many different solutions to this problem, here are two possible ones:

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","Since we have no information on the position of the point $Y$ along the side $BC$ we can assume without loss of generality, since for every choice along the line BC there exist points $X$, $Z$ such that $AXYZ$ is a square, that $Y=B$, and thus $Z$ lies in the center of the square, thus making the angle with the side $AD$ of $45^\circ$.",FF,"Fail, Fail, Fail",,,,,"{

(1 - q)^2.

\[
\boxed{q = 1 - \sqrt{1 - p}.}
\]","**Answer:** $q = 1 - \sqrt{1-p}$

**Proof:** Note that since $p$ denotes the probability that the box ends up containing at least one ball, then $1-p$ denotes the probability that the box doesn't contain any balls. On the other hand, the probability that the box doesn't end up containing even one ball is $(1-q)^2$. This is because each person doesn't drop a ball with probability $1-q$, and them dropping or not dropping a ball are independent events. Therefore, since both don't drop a ball with probability $1-q$, the probability that they both don't drop a ball is $(1-q)\cdot (1-q) = (1-q)^2$.

Therefore, we can conclude that $1 - p = \mathbb{P}[\text{neither player drops a ball}] = (1-q)^2$.

Since $0 < p < 1$, we have that $1-p>0$, so we can take the square root of $1-p$. Thus, taking the square root of both sides of the above equation gives us $\sqrt{1-p} = |1-q|$. As $q$ is a probability, then $q\leq 1$, so $|1-q| = 1-q$. Now we can rearrange to get:
\[\sqrt{1-p} = 1-q \Longrightarrow q = 1 - \sqrt{1-p}.\]

mem_cmcklx6hi00410vnqb6smhbz7,2025-07-04 12:34:07.853,There is a square $ABCD$ and a square $AXYZ$ such that $Y$ lies on segment $BC$. What is the measure of $\angle ADZ$?,probID_Two_Squares_Sharing_A,"There are many different solutions to this problem, here are two possible ones:

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","Since AXYZ and ABCD are square, we know that m(AXY)=m(ABY)=90, so AXBY is a cyclic quadrilateral. We also know that m(AZY)=90, so m(ABY)+m(AXY)=180 which means ABYZ is also cyclic. Since we know both AXBY and ABYZ are cyclic, AXBYZ is cyclic as well. 

So, m(ABZ)=m(AYZ)=45. We also know that m(ABD)=45, so B,Z,D must lay on the same line which gives m(ADZ)=45",BE,"Pass, Pass, Pass","B, A, B","B, E, E",None / None that won't hint towards a correct solution,"1. You wrote “$m(ABY)+m(AXY)=180$ which means $ABYZ$ is also cyclic.” In fact, to prove $ABYZ$ is cyclic you need  
$$m(ABY)+m(AZY)=90^\circ+90^\circ=180^\circ,$$  
not $m(AXY)$.  
2. Separate the claims when stating “$m(ABZ)=m(AYZ)=45$”: first note $m(ABZ)=m(AYZ)$ by equal inscribed angles, then observe $m(AYZ)=45^\circ$ because $AY$ is a diagonal of a square.","{

mem_clpwybpwp09qm0sqv5cbd9kyj,2025-07-04 12:34:55.939,There is a square $ABCD$ and a square $AXYZ$ such that $Y$ lies on segment $BC$. What is the measure of $\angle ADZ$?,probID_Two_Squares_Sharing_A,"There are many different solutions to this problem, here are two possible ones:

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","Let's prove that triangles AYC and AZD are similar. We will prove that by rotating the triangle AZD with the centre at point A and scaling it by sqrt(2) times. Then the segment AZ will transform to AY, segment AD will transform to AC, and then the triangles will be similar. Then they have the same angles. Then angle ADZ is equal to angle ACY. AC is a diagonal of the square, so the angle ACB is equal to 45 degrees. Angle  ACB is equal to angle ACY, and angle ACY is equal to angle ADZ. Then the measure if angle ADZ is 45 degrees.

(1 - q)^2.

\[

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","**Solution:** $45^\circ$

**Explanation:** Let P be the foot of the altitude from $Z$ to the segment $AD$ and let $Q$ be the foot of the altitude from $X$ to the segment $AB$. Also, let $a$ be the length of the side of the square $ABCD$, and $b$ the length of the side of the square $AZYX$. Since $\angle{PAZ}=\angle{QAX}=90^\circ-\angle{BAZ}=\alpha$, we have $AP=AQ=b\cos{\alpha}$. Hence, $BQ=DP=a-b\cos{\alpha}$. Additionally, $PZ=b\sin{\alpha}$. Let $X'$ be the foot of the altitude from $X$ to $BC$. Since $XY||AZ$ and $X'Y||AD$, we have $\angle{XYX'}=\angle{ZAD}=\alpha$. Therefore, $XX'=b\sin{\alpha}=BQ=PD$.

mem_clpwybpwp09qm0sqv5cbd9kyj,2025-07-04 12:39:41.872,There is a square $ABCD$ and a square $AXYZ$ such that $Y$ lies on segment $BC$. What is the measure of $\angle ADZ$?,probID_Two_Squares_Sharing_A,"There are many different solutions to this problem, here are two possible ones:

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","Let's prove that triangles AYC and AZD are similar. We will prove that by rotating the triangle AZD by 45 degrees with the centre at point A and scaling it by sqrt(2) times. As we know, the diagonal in the square is sqrt(2) times bigger than the side of the square, and the angle between the diagonal and the side is 45 degrees. Then the segment AZ will transform to AY because AY is a diagonal in the square AXYZ, segment AD will transform to AC because AC is a diagonal in the square ABCD, and then the triangles will be similar. Then they have the same angles. Then angle ADZ is equal to angle ACY. AC is a diagonal of the square, so the angle ACB is equal to 45 degrees. Angle  ACB is equal to angle ACY, and angle ACY is equal to angle ADZ. Then the measure if angle ADZ is 45 degrees.

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$.

Now $Z = C + (-i)(Y-C) = (t-1)/2 + i(1-t)/2$.
Notice that, for all choices of $t$, this satisfies the equation $\mathbb{Im}z = 1 - \mathbb{Re}z$, which is the equation of the line passing through $B$ and $D$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","Claim: $\triangle AZD \sim \triangle AXB$.
Proof: Clearly $AX = AZ$ and $AB=AD$ as they are sides of the same squares. Also $\angle XAB = 90 - \angle BAZ = 90 - (90 - \angle ZAD) = \angle ZAD$. By side-angle-side theorem, $\triangle AZD \sim \triangle AXB$.
Now we have that $\angle AXY = \angle ABY = 90$, so $AXBY$ is cyclic quadrialeral. Hence, $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$. But $\angle XYA = 45$ as $AY$ is diagonal of square $AXYZ$. Hence, $\angle ADZ = \angle  ABX = \angle AYX = 45$.",AB,"Pass, Pass, Pass","A, A, A","B, B, A",None,None,"{

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$.

Proof: Clearly $AX = AZ$ as they are sides of the square $AXYZ$ and $AB=AD$ as they are sides of the square $ABCD$. Also $\angle XAB = 90 - \angle BAZ = 90 - (90 - \angle ZAD) = \angle ZAD$ as $\angle XAZ = \angle BAD = 90$. By side-angle-side theorem, $\triangle ZAD \sim \triangle XAB$.
Now we have that $\angle AXY = \angle ABY = 90$, so $AXBY$ is cyclic quadrialeral. Hence, $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$ as they are angles of the same segment on cyclic quadrilateral $AXBY$.

Thus, the probability of the box ends up containing no ball (which is equals to \(1-p\) since it's the complementary event of the box ending up with at least one ball) is \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (1-q)^{2n} = 1-p  \). This is a geometric series, so we have that \( 1-p = \frac{(1-q)^2}{1-(1-q)^2} \implies p = 1- \frac{(1-q)^2}{1-(1-q)^2} = \frac{1-2(1-q)^2}{1-(1-q)^2} = \frac{4q-2q^2-1}{2q-q^2} \implies 2pq-pq^2=4q-2q^2-1\)
so we have that \( (2-p)q^2 - (4-2p)q + 1=0 \implies q = \frac{(4-2p)\pm \sqrt{(4-2p)^2-4(2-p)}}{2(2-p)} = \frac{(2-p) \pm \sqrt{(2-p)^2-(2-p)}}{(2-p)} = 1 \pm \frac{1-p}{\sqrt{2-p}}\).

mem_cmco2b0no00230wqhd1wyhxgl,2025-07-04 12:51:24.125,There is a square $ABCD$ and a square $AXYZ$ such that $Y$ lies on segment $BC$. What is the measure of $\angle ADZ$?,probID_Two_Squares_Sharing_A,"There are many different solutions to this problem, here are two possible ones:

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","Claim: $\triangle ZAD \sim \triangle XAB$.
Proof: Clearly $AX = AZ$ as they are sides of the square $AXYZ$ and $AB=AD$ as they are sides of the square $ABCD$. Also $\angle XAB = 90 - \angle BAZ = 90 - (90 - \angle ZAD) = \angle ZAD$ as $\angle XAZ = \angle BAD = 90$. By side-angle-side theorem, $\triangle ZAD \sim \triangle XAB$.
Now we have that $\angle AXY = \angle ABY = 90$, so $AXBY$ is cyclic quadrialeral. Hence, $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$ as they are angles of the same segment on cyclic quadrilateral $AXBY$. But $\angle XYA = 45$ as $AY$ is diagonal of square $AXYZ$. Hence, $\angle ADZ = \angle  ABX = \angle AYX = 45$. Hence, $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$.",AB,"Pass, Pass, Pass","A, A, A","B, B, B",None,None,"{

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","1. Let's prove that triangles AYC and AZD are similar. We will prove that by rotating the triangle AZD by 45 degrees with the centre at point A and scaling it by sqrt(2) times. As we know, the diagonal in the square is sqrt(2) times bigger than the side of the square, and the angle between the diagonal and the side is 45 degrees. Then the segment AZ will transform to AY because AY is a diagonal in the square AXYZ, segment AD will transform to AC because AC is a diagonal in the square ABCD, and then the triangles will be similar. 
Then, from the similarity of triangles AYZ and AZD, we know that angle ADZ is equal to the angle ACY.
2. Then they have the same angles. Then angle ADZ is equal to angle ACY. AC is a diagonal of the square, so the angle ACB is equal to 45 degrees. Angle  ACB is equal to angle ACY, and angle ACY is equal to angle ADZ. Then the measure if the angle ADZ is 45 degrees.

mem_cm7ai389f01fo0sq7c39o5nte,2025-07-04 12:55:10.740,There is a square $ABCD$ and a square $AXYZ$ such that $Y$ lies on segment $BC$. What is the measure of $\angle ADZ$?,probID_Two_Squares_Sharing_A,"There are many different solutions to this problem, here are two possible ones:

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","Answer: 45 degrees or \(\frac{\pi}{4}\)


Solution: 
First off to use some notation we will extend \(CD\) and \(YZ\) to meet at point \(N\).

Starting the solution off by noticing that \(XBYA\) is cyclic. To prove this we are going to use the fact that angles \(\angle AXY=\angle ABY=\frac{\pi}{2}\). This proves cyclicity. Now setting, \(\angle BYX=a\) we observe that by cyclicity: 
\[
a=\angle BYX=\angle BAX
\] 
also we observe that since AXYZ is a square, \(\angle AYX=\frac{\pi}{4}\) by cyclicity of \(XBYA\) again we observe that \(\angle ABX\) is also equal to \(\frac{\pi}{4}\).

Now we observe that \(\angle NYC= \frac{\pi}{2}-a\) given that we would have:
\[
\pi = \angle BYX+ \frac{\pi}{2}+\angle{NYC} \iff \angle NYC= \frac{\pi}{2}-a
\]

Given that \(\triangle CYN\) is a right triangle:
\[
\angle YNC=a
\]

To continue now we will prove that \(ZNAD\) is cyclic as well. To prove this we use that:
\[
\angle AZN= \frac{\pi}{2} \text{ which is true since } \angle YZA=\frac{\pi}{2}
\]

\[
\angle ADN= \frac{\pi}{2}
\]

So obviously \(ZNAD\) is cyclic. Therefore, \(\angle ZNA=\angle ZAD=a\)

Finally observe that triangles \(\triangle XAB= \triangle ZAD\) since they have the same angle \(a\) under equal sides \(AD=AB, XA=ZA\). Therefore we get that 
\[
\angle ZDA=\angle XBA= \frac{pi}{4}

Let us denote by $q$ the probability that a single person drops a ball. The probability that a person does not drop a ball is $1 - q$. Since the two people act independently, the probability that neither drops a ball is
\[
(1 - q)^2.

\[
(1 - q)^2 = 1 - p,

mem_cm7ai389f01fo0sq7c39o5nte,2025-07-04 12:57:31.937,There is a square $ABCD$ and a square $AXYZ$ such that $Y$ lies on segment $BC$. What is the measure of $\angle ADZ$?,probID_Two_Squares_Sharing_A,"There are many different solutions to this problem, here are two possible ones:

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","Answer: 45 degrees or \(\frac{\pi}{4}\)


Solution: 
First off to use some notation we will extend \(CD\) and \(YZ\) to meet at point \(N\).

Starting the solution off by noticing that \(XBYA\) is cyclic. To prove this we are going to use the fact that angles \(\angle AXY=\angle ABY=\frac{\pi}{2}\). This proves cyclicity. Now setting, \(\angle BYX=a\) we observe that by cyclicity: 
\[
a=\angle BYX=\angle BAX
\] 
also we observe that since AXYZ is a square, \(\angle AYX=\frac{\pi}{4}\) by cyclicity of \(XBYA\) again we observe that \(\angle ABX\) is also equal to \(\frac{\pi}{4}\).

Now we observe that \(\angle NYC= \frac{\pi}{2}-a\) given that we would have:
\[
\pi = \angle BYX+ \frac{\pi}{2}+\angle{NYC} \iff \angle NYC= \frac{\pi}{2}-a
\]

Given that \(\triangle CYN\) is a right triangle:
\[
\angle YNC=a
\]

To continue now we will prove that \(ZNAD\) is cyclic as well. To prove this we use that:
\[
\angle AZN= \frac{\pi}{2} \text{ which is true since } \angle YZA=\frac{\pi}{2}
\]

\[
\angle ADN= \frac{\pi}{2}
\]

So obviously \(ZNAD\) is cyclic. Therefore, \(\angle ZNA=\angle ZAD=a\)

Finally observe that triangles \(\triangle XAB= \triangle ZAD\) since they have the same angle \(a\) under equal sides \(AD=AB, XA=ZA\). Therefore we get that 
\[
\angle ZDA=\angle XBA= \frac{pi}{4}

b) Does the statement remain true if $k=10$?",probID_Divisibility_Rearrangement_Simplified,"**Part a)** Consider an arbitrary labeling of the numbers as $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{11}$. Let $S$ denote their sum, and define
\[
A = 1 \cdot a_1 + 2 \cdot a_2 + \cdots + 11 \cdot a_{11}.
\]
Since $S$ is not divisible by $11$, observe that the numbers
\[
A, \quad A + S, \quad A + 2S, \quad \ldots, \quad A + 10S
\]
have pairwise distinct remainders modulo $11$. (This follows easily by contradiction: if $A + rS \equiv A + sS \pmod{11}$ for $r \neq s$, then $(r - s)S \equiv 0$, implying $S \equiv 0$, a contradiction.)

Among these 11 numbers, one must be congruent to $0$ modulo $11$. That is, there exists an integer $k$ with $0 \le k \le 10$ such that
\[
A + kS \equiv 0 \pmod{11}.
\]
Finally, note that cyclically shifting the indices by $k$ corresponds to replacing the original labeling with
\[
a_{k+1}, \quad a_{k+2}, \quad \ldots, \quad a_{k+11},

where indices are taken modulo $11$. In this shifted labeling, the sum
\[
1 \cdot a_{k+1} + 2 \cdot a_{k+2} + \cdots + 11 \cdot a_{k+11}

**Part b)** 

*Answer:* It is not true.

*Explanation*: Suppse that the numbers are $3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1$. Then
- Their sum is $3 + 9 = 12$, which is not divisible by 10, i.e. the condition is satisfied.
- For any naming of them $a_1, ..., a_{10}$, the sum $1 \cdot a_1 + 2 \cdot a_2 + ... + 10 \cdot a_{10}$ will be equal to $(1 + 2 + ... + 10) + 2 \cdot t$ where $a_t = 3$. I.e. that sum will be equal to $55 + 2t$, which is an odd number, and therefore not divisible by $10$ no matter what the $t$ is.","(a) Let's name the given k = 11 numbers x1, x2, ..., x11 in arbitrary order. Let's look at the following 11 sums x1 + 2*x2 + … + 11*x11, x2 + 2*x3 + ... + 11*x1, … and so on, where each sum is built like the previous one with an index shift which is equal to 1. If any of these sums are equal modulo 11, their difference will be equal to n * (x1 + x2 + ... + x11), where n is a natural number equal to index shift. But since 1<=n<11 and 11 does not divide (x1 + ... + x11), it can't be true. Therefore all of these eleven sums are unique modulo 11. And that means that one of them is equal to 0 modulo 11 and is divisible by 11. Q.E.D
(b) Let's take a1 = a2 = … = a10 = 1. Therefore any order we make the 1's, since they are all equal, we'll get the same set of numbers.

mem_cmcnzxhmj01ar0wq31yvq9vqd,2025-07-04 13:04:29.302,There is a square $ABCD$ and a square $AXYZ$ such that $Y$ lies on segment $BC$. What is the measure of $\angle ADZ$?,probID_Two_Squares_Sharing_A,"There are many different solutions to this problem, here are two possible ones:

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","The answer is \(45 º \). 

Observe that since \(AXYZ\) and \(ABCD\) are squares, we have that \(AZ=AX\) and \(AD= AB\). Moreover, \( \angle XAZ = \angle BAD = 90º \implies \angle ZDA = \angle XBA\).

Therefore, triangles \(AXB, AZD\) are congruent, so \(\angle ADZ = \angle ABX \).

Now, notice that since \(Y \in BC \implies \angle CBA = \angle YBA = 90º \implies B\) lies on the circle with diameter \(AY\), so \(A,X,B,Y,Z\) are concyclic. 

This implies that \( \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA= 45º\), because \(XYZA\) is a square.",EB,"Pass, Pass, Pass","E, E, E","B, E, B","1.

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","Since AXYZ and ABCD are square, we know that m(AXY)=m(ABY)=90, so AXBY is a cyclic quadrilateral. 

We also know that m(AZY)=m(ABY)=90, so m(ABY)+m(AZY)=180 which means ABYZ is also cyclic. Since we know both AXBY and ABYZ are cyclic, AXBYZ is cyclic as well. 

So, due to equal inscribed angles m(ABZ)=m(AYZ). So, since m(AYZ)=45, m(ABZ)=45. We also know that m(ABD)=45 which gives m(ABZ)=m(ABD).

mem_cmcnzxhmj01ar0wq31yvq9vqd,2025-07-04 13:07:32.462,There is a square $ABCD$ and a square $AXYZ$ such that $Y$ lies on segment $BC$. What is the measure of $\angle ADZ$?,probID_Two_Squares_Sharing_A,"There are many different solutions to this problem, here are two possible ones:

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","The answer is \(45 º \). 

Observe that since \(AXYZ\) and \(ABCD\) are squares, we have that \(AZ=AX\) and \(AD= AB\). Moreover, \( \angle XAZ = \angle BAD = 90º \implies \angle ZAD = \angle XAB\).

Therefore, by SAS, triangles \(AXB, AZD\) are congruent, so \(\angle ADZ = \angle ABX \).

Now, notice that since \(Y \in BC \implies \angle CBA = \angle YBA = 90º \implies B\) lies on the circle with diameter \(AY\), so \(A,X,B,Y,Z\) are concyclic. 

This implies that \( \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA= 45º\), because \(XYZA\) is a square.",EB,"Pass, Pass, Pass","E, B, E","B, B, B","1. The implication “since $\angle XAZ=\angle BAD=90^\circ$ then $\angle ZAD=\angle XAB$” is invalid without a clear rotation or reflection argument.

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$.

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","The answer is \(45 º \). 

Observe that since \(AXYZ\) and \(ABCD\) are squares, we have that \(AZ=AX\) and \(AD= AB\). Moreover, \( \angle XAZ = \angle BAD = 90º \implies \angle XAZ = \angle XAB + \angle BAZ = \angle BAD = \angle \ZAD + \angle BAZ \implies \angle ZAD = \angle XAB\).

Therefore, since  \(AX = AZ, AB=AD\) and \(\angle ZAD = \angle BAX\), triangles \(AXB, AZD\) are congruent (by SAS), so \(\angle ADZ = \angle ABX \).

Now, notice that since \(Y \in BC \implies \angle CBA = \angle YBA = 90º \implies B\) lies on the circle with diameter \(AY\). Since \(\angle AXY = \angle AZY = 90º\), \(X,Z\) also lie on the circle with diameter \(AY\). This implies that \(A,X,B,Y,Z\) are concyclic. 

This implies that \( \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA= 45º\), because \(XYZA\) is a square.",BB,"Pass, Pass, Pass","A, B, A","B, B, B",None / None that won't hint towards a correct solution,None / None that won't hint towards a correct solution,"{

b) Does the statement remain true if $k=10$?",probID_Divisibility_Rearrangement_Simplified,"**Part a)** Consider an arbitrary labeling of the numbers as $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{11}$. Let $S$ denote their sum, and define
\[
A = 1 \cdot a_1 + 2 \cdot a_2 + \cdots + 11 \cdot a_{11}.
\]
Since $S$ is not divisible by $11$, observe that the numbers
\[
A, \quad A + S, \quad A + 2S, \quad \ldots, \quad A + 10S
\]
have pairwise distinct remainders modulo $11$. (This follows easily by contradiction: if $A + rS \equiv A + sS \pmod{11}$ for $r \neq s$, then $(r - s)S \equiv 0$, implying $S \equiv 0$, a contradiction.)

Among these 11 numbers, one must be congruent to $0$ modulo $11$. That is, there exists an integer $k$ with $0 \le k \le 10$ such that
\[
A + kS \equiv 0 \pmod{11}.
\]
Finally, note that cyclically shifting the indices by $k$ corresponds to replacing the original labeling with
\[
a_{k+1}, \quad a_{k+2}, \quad \ldots, \quad a_{k+11},
\]
where indices are taken modulo $11$. In this shifted labeling, the sum
\[
1 \cdot a_{k+1} + 2 \cdot a_{k+2} + \cdots + 11 \cdot a_{k+11}

**Part b)** 

*Answer:* It is not true.

*Explanation*: Suppse that the numbers are $3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1$. Then
- Their sum is $3 + 9 = 12$, which is not divisible by 10, i.e. the condition is satisfied.
- For any naming of them $a_1, ..., a_{10}$, the sum $1 \cdot a_1 + 2 \cdot a_2 + ... + 10 \cdot a_{10}$ will be equal to $(1 + 2 + ... + 10) + 2 \cdot t$ where $a_t = 3$. I.e. that sum will be equal to $55 + 2t$, which is an odd number, and therefore not divisible by $10$ no matter what the $t$ is.","We split the solution into two parts: one for a) and one for b). Let the numbers be $b_1$, $b_2$, $\ldots$, $b_k$ before arranging them as the $a_i$.

a) Here $k = 11$. Let us assume the contrary and assume that there doesn't exist such an arrangement $\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{11}\}$ such that $11\mid 1\cdot a_1 + 2\cdot a_2 +\cdots + 11\cdot a_{11}$. Then, let us denote 
\[r = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{11} b_i \pmod{11}\]
i.e. $r$ is the remainder of the sum of all numbers modulo $k = 11$. Now let us consider the sums
\[s_1 = b_1 + 2b_2 + \cdots +10b_{10} + 11b_{11},\]
\[s_2 = b_2 + 2b_3 + \cdots +10b_{11} + 11b_{1},\]
and so on to
\[s_{11} = b_{11} + 2b_1 + \cdots + 10b_{9} + 11b_{10}.\]
Note that the $s_i$ are created in such a way that
\[s_{i+1} - s_i = \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{11} j\cdot b_{i+j} - \sum\limits_{j=1}^{11} j \cdot b_{i+j-1} \equiv \sum\limits_{j=1}^{11} b_j \equiv r\pmod{11}.\]
where the indices are taken modulo $11$, i.e. $b_{12} = b_1$ and so on. Now, since $r\not\equiv 0\pmod{11}$ and $11$ is a prime, there exists some integer $0\leq t\leq 10$ such that $11\mid s_1 +tr$. In fact, we can find that $t = -\frac{s_1}{r} \pmod{11}$, which exists as $11$ is prime and we know that $r\not\equiv 0\pmod{11}$. Now, from above, it only remains to be seen that $s_{1+t}$ is divisible by $11$ as $s_{1+t} \equiv s_1 + t\cdot r \equiv 0\pmod{11}$, as desired. Hence our assumption was wrong, which concludes the solution, and we showed that such an arrangement exists.

b) No, this is not necessarily true for $k = 10$. Consider the numbers $1$, $1$, $1$, $1$, $1$, $1$, $1$, $1$, $1$, and $3$. These are $10$ integers with sum $12$, which is not divisible by $10$. Furthermore, if we assume that an arrangement exists such that $\sum_{i=1}^{10} i\cdot a_i$ is divisible by $10$, then if $a_i = 3$, the sum evaluates to $(3-1) \cdot i + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{10} i\cdot 1 = 2i + 55$. However, $10\nmid 55 + 2i$ for any integer $i$ as $55+2i$ is always odd, but $10$ is even, This is a sufficient counterexample, so we're done.",AA,"Pass, Pass, Pass","A, A, A","A, A, A",None,None,"{

Each person drops a ball with probability $q$. If the probability that the box ends up containing at least one ball is a given number $0 < p < 1$, express $q$ in terms of $p$.",probID_Classic_Probability_Non-Empty_Box,"**Answer:** $q = 1 - \sqrt{1 - p}$

**Solution:** 
Let us denote by $q$ the probability that a single person drops a ball. The probability that a person does not drop a ball is $1 - q$. Since the two people act independently, the probability that neither drops a ball is
\[
(1 - q)^2.
\]
Therefore, the probability that the box contains at least one ball is
\[
p = 1 - (1 - q)^2.
\]
Solving for $q$:
\[
1 - (1 - q)^2 = p,
\]
\[
(1 - q)^2 = 1 - p,
\]
\[
1 - q = \sqrt{1 - p},
\]
\[
q = 1 - \sqrt{1 - p}.
\]
\[
\boxed{q = 1 - \sqrt{1 - p}.}
\]","**Answer:** $q = 1 - \sqrt{1-p}$

**Proof:** Note that since $p$ denotes the probability that the box ends up containing at least one ball, then $1-p$ denotes the probability that the box doesn't contain any balls. On the other hand, the probability that the box doesn't end up containing even one ball is $(1-q)^2$. This is because each person doesn't drop a ball with probability $1-q$, and them dropping or not dropping a ball are independent events. Therefore, since both don't drop a ball with probability $1-q$, the probability that they both don't drop a ball is $(1-q)\cdot (1-q) = (1-q)^2$.

Therefore, we can conclude that $1 - p = \mathbb{P}[\text{neither player drops a ball}] = (1-q)^2$.

Since $0 < p < 1$, we have that $1-p>0$, so we can take the square root of $1-p$. Thus, taking the square root of both sides of the above equation gives us $\sqrt{1-p} = |1-q|$. As $q$ is a probability, then $q\leq 1$, so $|1-q| = 1-q$. Now we can rearrange to get:
\[\sqrt{1-p} = 1-q \Longrightarrow q = 1 - \sqrt{1-p}.\]

mem_cmclrztux000f0vmv94xyaecw,2025-07-04 13:14:07.851,There is a square $ABCD$ and a square $AXYZ$ such that $Y$ lies on segment $BC$. What is the measure of $\angle ADZ$?,probID_Two_Squares_Sharing_A,"There are many different solutions to this problem, here are two possible ones:

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","Let the point T be an intersection of lines YZ and CD, angle AYZ = 45, because AXYZ is a square, similarly angle ACD = 45, therefore quadrilateral AYCT is inscribe. Then by the Simson Line Theorem for Triangle YCT and point A on this triangle's circumcircle: B, Z, D are the closest points on respective lines YC, YT, CT and therefore collinear.

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","The answer is \(45 º \). 

Firstly, observe that since \(AXYZ\) and \(ABCD\) are squares, we have that \(AZ=AX\) and \(AD= AB\). 

Secondly, notice that \( \angle XAZ = \angle BAD = 90º \implies \angle XAZ = \angle XAB + \angle BAZ = \angle BAD = \angle ZAD + \angle BAZ \implies \angle ZAD = \angle XAB\).

Therefore, since  \(AX = AZ, AB=AD\) and \(\angle ZAD = \angle BAX\), triangles \(AXB, AZD\) are congruent (by SAS), so \(\angle ADZ = \angle ABX \).

Now, notice that since \(Y \in BC \implies \angle CBA = \angle YBA = 90º \implies B\) lies on the circle with diameter \(AY\). Since \(\angle AXY = \angle AZY = 90º\), \(X,Z\) also lie on the circle with diameter \(AY\). This implies that \(A,X,B,Y,Z\) are concyclic. 

This implies that \( \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA= 45º\), because \(XYZA\) is a square.",AB,"Pass, Pass, Pass","A, A, A","A, B, B",None,None,"{

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","**Answer:** $45^\circ$

**Proof:**
Label the side length of the square $ABCD$ as $a$ and the side length of the square $XYZA$ as $b$. Label points $P$ and $Q$ as the foots of altitudes from $Z$ to $AD$ and from $X$ to $AB$ respectively. Then, $AP=AQ=b\cos{\alpha}$ since $\angle{PAZ}=\angle{QAX}=\alpha=90^\circ-\angle{BAZ}$. Thus, $BQ=PD=a-b\cos{\alpha}$. Additionally, $PZ=b\sin{\alpha}$. Label as $X'$ the foot of the altitude from $X$ to $BC$. Then, since $AD||BC$ and $AZ||XY$ we get $X'YX=BYX=\alpha$ and from that $XX' = b\sin{\alpha}$. Since XX'BQ is a rectangle, we get $b\sin{\alpha}=XX'=BQ=PD$. Therefore, $PD=b\sin{\alpha}=PZ$ which means, since $\angle{ZPD}=90^\circ$, $PDZ$ is a right angled isosceles triangle. Thus, $\angle{ADZ}=\angle{PDZ}=45^\circ$.

mem_cmckk9n0h001k0wob2fwzbs7o,2025-07-04 13:21:04.737,There is a square $ABCD$ and a square $AXYZ$ such that $Y$ lies on segment $BC$. What is the measure of $\angle ADZ$?,probID_Two_Squares_Sharing_A,"There are many different solutions to this problem, here are two possible ones:

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","Plot this onto the complex plane, thus having
\[
A = 0, \quad B = i, \quad C = 1 + i, \quad D = 1,
\]
and for some \( 0 < t < 1 \), have \( Y = t + i \).

Then, the center of the square \( XYZA \), which is also the midpoint of \( AY \), is
\[
O := \frac{A + Y}{2} = \frac{t + i}{2},
\]
and the vector
\[
Y - O = \frac{Y - A}{2} = \frac{t + i}{2}.
\]

Now,
\[
Z = O + (-i)(Y - O) = \frac{t + 1}{2} + i \cdot \frac{1 - t}{2},
\]
where multiplication by \( -i \) means a clockwise rotation by \( 90^\circ \).

Notice that, for all choices of \( t \), this satisfies the equation
\[
\Im z = 1 - \Re z,
\]
which is the equation of the line passing through \( B \) and \( D \), which is trivial to check. This means that \( Z \) lies in the diagonal \( BD \), and thus
\[
\angle ADZ = 45^\circ.

b) Does the statement remain true if $k=10$?",probID_Divisibility_Rearrangement_Simplified,"**Part a)** Consider an arbitrary labeling of the numbers as $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{11}$. Let $S$ denote their sum, and define
\[
A = 1 \cdot a_1 + 2 \cdot a_2 + \cdots + 11 \cdot a_{11}.
\]
Since $S$ is not divisible by $11$, observe that the numbers
\[
A, \quad A + S, \quad A + 2S, \quad \ldots, \quad A + 10S
\]
have pairwise distinct remainders modulo $11$. (This follows easily by contradiction: if $A + rS \equiv A + sS \pmod{11}$ for $r \neq s$, then $(r - s)S \equiv 0$, implying $S \equiv 0$, a contradiction.)

Among these 11 numbers, one must be congruent to $0$ modulo $11$. That is, there exists an integer $k$ with $0 \le k \le 10$ such that
\[
A + kS \equiv 0 \pmod{11}.

**Part b)** 

*Answer:* It is not true.

*Explanation*: Suppse that the numbers are $3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1$. Then
- Their sum is $3 + 9 = 12$, which is not divisible by 10, i.e. the condition is satisfied.
- For any naming of them $a_1, ..., a_{10}$, the sum $1 \cdot a_1 + 2 \cdot a_2 + ... + 10 \cdot a_{10}$ will be equal to $(1 + 2 + ... + 10) + 2 \cdot t$ where $a_t = 3$. I.e. that sum will be equal to $55 + 2t$, which is an odd number, and therefore not divisible by $10$ no matter what the $t$ is.","(a) Let's name the given k = 11 numbers x1, x2, ..., x11 in arbitrary order. Let's look at the following 11 sums: x1 + 2*x2 + … + 11*x11, x2 + 2*x3 + ... + 11*x1, … and so on, where each sum is built like the previous one with an index shift which is equal to 1. If any two out of these sums are equal modulo 11, their difference will be equal to n * (x1 + x2 + ... + x11), where n is a natural number equal to index shift. But since 1<=n<11 and 11 does not divide (x1 + ... + x11), then n * (x1 + x2 + ... + x11) is not divisible by 11. But this sum is equal to the difference of two numbers which are equal by modulo 11 and must be divisible by 11. So there are no two sums out of these 11 that are equal by modulo 11. Therefore all of these eleven sums are unique modulo 11. And that means that one of them is equal to 0 modulo 11 and is divisible by 11. Q.E.D",-B,"Pass, Pass, Pass","B, E, A","B, A, B",,,"{

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$.

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus

Next, for each of the $2500$ rectangles of size $1 \times 3$, let us mark their middle cell in red. Note that none of the marked red cells can coincide with the cell $X$. Therefore, each of the $2500$ red cells lies inside one of the earlier-considered $2499$ squares of size $2 \times 2$.

mem_cmcnzxhmj01ar0wq31yvq9vqd,2025-07-04 13:23:24.951,There is a square $ABCD$ and a square $AXYZ$ such that $Y$ lies on segment $BC$. What is the measure of $\angle ADZ$?,probID_Two_Squares_Sharing_A,"There are many different solutions to this problem, here are two possible ones:

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","The answer is \(45 º \). 

Firstly, observe that since \(AXYZ\) and \(ABCD\) are squares, we have that \(AZ=AX\) and \(AD= AB\). 

Secondly, notice that \( \angle XAZ = \angle BAD = 90º \), so \(\angle XAZ = \angle XAB + \angle BAZ = \angle BAD = \angle ZAD + \angle BAZ \implies \angle ZAD = \angle XAB\).

Therefore, since  \(AX = AZ, AB=AD\) and \(\angle ZAD = \angle BAX\), triangles \(AXB, AZD\) are congruent (by SAS), so \(\angle ADZ = \angle ABX \).

Now, notice that since \(Y \in BC \implies \angle CBA = \angle YBA = 90º \implies B\) lies on the circle with diameter \(AY\). 
In addition, since \(\angle AXY = \angle AZY = 90º\), \(X,Z\) also lie on the circle with diameter \(AY\). This implies that \(A,X,B,Y,Z\) are concyclic. 

This implies that \( \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA= 45º\), because \(XYZA\) is a square.",AB,"Pass, Pass, Pass","A, A, A","B, B, A",None,None,"{

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$.

Since AXYZ and ABCD are square, we know that m(AXY)=m(ABY)=90, so since they are equal inscribed angles, AXBY is a cyclic quadrilateral. 

2nd step
We also know that m(AZY)=m(ABY)=90, so m(ABY)+m(AZY)=180 which means ABYZ is also cyclic. 

3rd step
We know both AXBY and ABYZ are cyclic which means X and Z are on the same circle, specifically the circumcircle of ABY. So, AXBYZ is also cyclic.

4th step
So, due to equal inscribed angles m(ABZ)=m(AYZ). So, we know that AY is a diagonal of the square AXYZ so, m(AYZ)=45 Since m(AYZ)=45, m(ABZ)=45. We also know that m(ABD)=45 which gives m(ABZ)=m(ABD).

Each of them can be any of the $2025-1=2024$ marked points (except for the rightmost one).

Observe that the longer of the two segments with left endpoint $A$ must necessarily contain the shorter one. This finishes the proof.","Let's first rephrase the fact from the question for the number n:
There are n points marked on a line, and there are n different segments, whose endpoints are among these marked points. Prove that among them, there are two segments such that one contains another one.
Let's prove this fact by induction on n:
Base: Let there be 3 points and 3 segments with the ends in those points. We can only build 3 segments on those points (points are numbered 1, 2 and 3): (1,3), (1,2) and (2,3). But the segment (1,3) contains segment (1,2) and this will be the pair of segments we were looking for.

Induction: Now suppose that for every n<k we have proved that among n segments on n points, there will be two segments that one contains another one. Now let's prove the fact from the question for k points and k segments. 
Let's look at the right-most point on a line. If there is no segment that has the end at this point, then we can delete it and get k segments on (k-1) points, which is even stronger than the fact in the assumption. By assumption of the induction, we know that there will be two segments one of which contains the second one, which will lead to a solution. So let's look at the situation if there is a segment that has the right-most point as one of its ends. Then let's prove that there is no other segment containing this point. Suppose there is one. Then, because segments are different, the end of one of those two segments will be more left than the second end of other one. But then this segment contains the other one, which also solves the problem. Then we can suppose that there is only one segment that contains the right-most point. But then we can delete this segment and right-most point and get (k-1) points and k segments, where by assumption of induction will be 2 segments on of which contains the other one.

This finishes the proof.","Since there are 2025 segments and each segment uses 2 points, then there are 2*2025=4050 endpoints total used in the segments.

Lemma 1: If a point A has at least 2 other points it is connected to and these points are on one side of the point A, one of them contains another one.
Proof: Let's take two points B and C on one side to A. Then, since A is a static point, either AB is longer and it contains AC (since B and C are different points) or vice verse. Thus, one segment would contain another.
Lemma 2: The leftmost endpoint can be used in no more than 1 segment.
Proof: If there are at least two segments the leftmost point is attached to, then all the points it is attached to are on to the right of that point (since it is the leftmost point). Then, by Lemma 1, one segment will contain another.

Therefore, the leftmost point can be in no more than in one segment (so it is used as one endpoint). Since there are in total of 4050 endpoints used for these segments, the rest 2024 points (to the right of the leftmost point) are used in at least 4049 endpoints (because the leftmost point is used in no more than 1) .

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","1. Let's prove that triangles AYC and AZD are similar. We will prove that by rotating the triangle AZD by 45 degrees with the centre at point A and scaling it by sqrt(2) times. As we know, the diagonal in the square is sqrt(2) times bigger than the side of the square, and the angle between the diagonal and the side is 45 degrees. Then the segment AZ will transform to AY because AY is a diagonal in the square AXYZ, segment AD will transform to AC because AC is a diagonal in the square ABCD, and then the triangles will be similar. 
Then they have the same angles and angle ACY equals to angle ADZ. 
2. Now we will find the measure of the angle ACY and say that it is equal to the measure of angle ADZ. AC is a diagonal of the square, so the angle ACB is equal to 45 degrees. Angle  ACB is equal to angle ACY, and angle ACY is equal to angle ADZ. Then the measure of angle ADZ is 45 degrees.

b) Does the statement remain true if $k=10$?",probID_Divisibility_Rearrangement_Simplified,"**Part a)** Consider an arbitrary labeling of the numbers as $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{11}$. Let $S$ denote their sum, and define
\[
A = 1 \cdot a_1 + 2 \cdot a_2 + \cdots + 11 \cdot a_{11}.
\]
Since $S$ is not divisible by $11$, observe that the numbers
\[
A, \quad A + S, \quad A + 2S, \quad \ldots, \quad A + 10S
\]
have pairwise distinct remainders modulo $11$. (This follows easily by contradiction: if $A + rS \equiv A + sS \pmod{11}$ for $r \neq s$, then $(r - s)S \equiv 0$, implying $S \equiv 0$, a contradiction.)

Among these 11 numbers, one must be congruent to $0$ modulo $11$. That is, there exists an integer $k$ with $0 \le k \le 10$ such that
\[
A + kS \equiv 0 \pmod{11}.

**Part b)** 

*Answer:* It is not true.

*Explanation*: Suppse that the numbers are $3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1$. Then
- Their sum is $3 + 9 = 12$, which is not divisible by 10, i.e. the condition is satisfied.
- For any naming of them $a_1, ..., a_{10}$, the sum $1 \cdot a_1 + 2 \cdot a_2 + ... + 10 \cdot a_{10}$ will be equal to $(1 + 2 + ... + 10) + 2 \cdot t$ where $a_t = 3$. I.e. that sum will be equal to $55 + 2t$, which is an odd number, and therefore not divisible by $10$ no matter what the $t$ is.","a)
Let the $\sum_{j=1}^k a_j = b\neq0 \mod{k}$.
Now notice that when we add $b$ to the sum $\sum_{j=1}^k ja_j$ what happens is the following:
$$
b + \sum_{j=1}^k ja_j = \sum_{j=1}^k a_j + \sum_{j=1}^k ja_j = \sum_{j=1}^k (j+1)a_j = \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} j a_{j+1}
$$
That is adding $b$ to the sum results in a right shift in the permutation of the numbers $a_j$.
Now let $b^{-1}$ be the multiplicative inverse mod $k$ of $b$ (which exists since $k$ is prime and $b$ is non-zero) and $m$ the value of the sum with the initial permutation. This means that adding $b$, which is equivalent to shifting the permutation, $(k-m)b^{-1}$ (which is just an integer) times results in adding $k-m$ to the sum, making it zero mod $k$.

b)
Since $k$ is not prime, our argument does not work anymore.
In fact, we want $b$ not to be invertible, such as $b=4$.
A good counterexample is all 1s and a 5.
Suppose the 5 is at position $j$, then the sum evaluates to $j(5-1) + (1+2+3+\ldots +10)$ = $4j+5$ which cannot be zero mod $10$.",AB,"Pass, Pass, Pass","A, A, A","B, B, A",None,None,"{

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.","1st step
Since AXYZ and ABCD are square, we know that $\angle AXY=\angle ABY=90$, so since they are equal inscribed angles, AXBY is a cyclic quadrilateral. 
2nd step
We also know that $\angle AZY=\angle ABY=90$, so $\angle ABY+\angle AZY=180$ which means ABYZ is also cyclic. 
3rd step
We know both AXBY and ABYZ are cyclic which means X and Z are on the same circle, specifically the circumcircle of ABY. So, AXBYZ is also cyclic.
4th step
So, due to equal inscribed angles $\angle ABZ=\angle AYZ$. So, we know that AY is a diagonal of the square AXYZ so, $\angle AYZ=45$ Since $\angle AYZ=45, $\angle ABZ$ also equals to $45$. We also know that $\angle ABD=45$ which gives $\angle ABZ=\angle ABD$.

- Their sum is $3 + 9 = 12$, which is not divisible by 10, i.e. the condition is satisfied.
- For any naming of them $a_1, ..., a_{10}$, the sum $1 \cdot a_1 + 2 \cdot a_2 + ... + 10 \cdot a_{10}$ will be equal to $(1 + 2 + ... + 10) + 2 \cdot t$ where $a_t = 3$. I.e. that sum will be equal to $55 + 2t$, which is an odd number, and therefore not divisible by $10$ no matter what the $t$ is.","a)
Let the $\sum_{j=1}^k a_j = b\neq0 \mod{k}$.
Now notice that when we add $b$ to the sum $m=\sum_{j=1}^k ja_j$ what happens is the following:
$$
b + \sum_{j=1}^k ja_j = \sum_{j=1}^k a_j + \sum_{j=1}^k ja_j = \sum_{j=1}^k (j+1)a_j = \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} j a_{j+1}
$$
That is adding $b$ to the sum results in a right shift in the permutation of the numbers $a_j$.
Now let $b^{-1}$ be the multiplicative inverse mod $k$ of $b$ (which exists since $k$ is prime and $b$ is non-zero). This means that adding $b$, which is equivalent to shifting the permutation, $(k-m)b^{-1}$ (which is just an integer) times results in adding $k-m$ to the sum, making it zero mod $k$.

b)
Since $k$ is not prime, our argument does not work anymore.
In fact, we want $b$ not to be invertible, such as $b=4$.
A good counterexample is all 1s and a 5.
Suppose the 5 is at position $j$, then the sum evaluates to $j(5-1) + (1+2+3+\ldots +10)$ = $4j+5$ which cannot be zero mod $10$.",AB,"Pass, Pass, Pass","A, A, A","B, B, B",None,None,"{

Finally, observe that if two rectangles have their red cells inside the same $2 \times 2$ square $S$, then they must share a border of length at least $2$. Indeed, if the red cells are adjacent, the rectangles share a common side of length $3$, and if the red cells are in opposite corners of $S$, their shared border has length $2$.

mem_clq5a65rs0lg10stc3ka0gxy8,2025-07-04 13:34:04.918,There is a square $ABCD$ and a square $AXYZ$ such that $Y$ lies on segment $BC$. What is the measure of $\angle ADZ$?,probID_Two_Squares_Sharing_A,"There are many different solutions to this problem, here are two possible ones:

**Answer: $45^{\circ}$**

**Explanation 1**:
1. Suppose that the $\angle ZAD = x$. Then $\angle BAZ = 90^{\circ} - x$, from where $\angle BAX = 90^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} - x) = x = \angle ZAD$.

2. Since $AXYZ$ and $ABCD$ are squares, we know that $AX = AZ$ and $AB = AD$. Combining these with the equality from step 1, we can conclude that the triangle $BAX$ is equal to the triangle $DAZ$. Therefore $\angle ZDA$ (which is the one we are trying to find the measure of) is equal to $\angle XBA$. 

3. Finally, note that all of the points $A, X, B, Y, Z$ lie on the same circle with diameter $AY$, in particular $AXBY$ is concyclic. From here we get that $\angle XBA = \angle XYA$, and that last angle is $45^{\circ}$ (angle between a diagonal and a side of the square). Thus 

\[ \angle ZDA = \angle XBA = \angle XYA = 45^{\circ} \]

Hence the answer.

**Explanation 2**:

Consider the rotational homothety $f$ with center $A$ that maps $C$ to $B$, i.e. $f(C) = B$. This rotational homothety transforms $ABCD$ square into another square $f(A)f(B)f(C)f(D) = AB'BD'$, where $D'$ is clearly the center of $ABCD$. 

Now, since $Y$ belongs to $Cf(C) = CB$ and since $AXYZ$ is a square, from the standard properties of rotational  homothety (specifically preservation of co-linearity), we must have that $Z$ belongs $Df(D) = DD'$. I.e. $Z$ must be on the diagonal $DB$, and therefore $\angle ADZ = 45^{\circ}$ as the angle between diagonal and the side of a square.",https://quanta-images-and-pdfs.lon1.digitaloceanspaces.com/1751635097916_IMG_9126.jpeg,EE,"Pass, Pass, Fail","E, E, F","E, F, E","1.
