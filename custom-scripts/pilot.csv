The first digit can't be a zero since we're looking for six-digit numbers. However, since no two consecutive digits are zeros, at most one of the second and third is a zero, at most one of the fourth and fifth digit is a zero.

Hence, as we must have $3$ zeros, the last digit must be a zero. Therefore, the fifth digit isn't a zero. But now two of the second, third and fourth digit must be zeros, and they must not be consecutive. Therefore, the second, fourth, and sixth digit must be zeros.

**Explanation:**
1. Note that since there are 3 non-adjacent zeros, they have to be in places 2, 4, 6 when counted from the left. I.e. the only way a 6-digit number satisfies the condition is if it is of the form $\overline{a0b0c0}$.

**Explanation:**
1. Note that since there are 3 non-adjacent zeros, they have to be in places 2, 4, 6 when counted from the left. I.e. the only way a 6-digit number satisfies the condition is if it is of the form $\overline{a0b0c0}$.
2. The remaining 3 digits ($a, b, c$) can be arbitrary with the only condition that $a, b, c$ are not a $0$. Therefore, the total number of such 6-digit numbers is 
\[ 9 \cdot 9 \cdot 9 = 729 \]","The answer is 729.
1st step:
We have 5 decimal places to put 3 non consecutive 0's. (We know that numbers do not begin with a zero, so 5 places are left.)
2nd step:
Since we have 5 decimal places to put 3 non consecutive 0's, our numbers should be in a0b0c0 format. Because if there is a 0 in positions 3 or 5 (so other than 2, 4,  and 6), one of the other 0's must be adjacent to that 0.
3rd step:
We know that a, b, c are different than 0 and can be any value except for 0. 
4th step:
Since a, b, c all have 9 value possibilities, there are $9^3=729$ numbers holding the condition.",BB,"Pass, Pass, Pass","B, B, B","B, B, B",None / None that won't hint towards a correct solution,"You state that “$$a, b, c$$ are different than 0 and can be any value except for 0,” giving each 9 choices.

$a_1$ can't be zero, and out of the 5 remaining, we need that no 2 zeros are adjacent.
if $a_3=0$, we can't put a zero on the second and fourth spot, because no two zeros are adjacent, so we have to put them in 5th and 6th, but then they'd be adjacent, so $a_3\neq0$.
if $a_5=0$, $a_4\neq0, a_6\neq0$, and because we need 2 more zeroes and have only 2 digits available, $a_2=0$ and $a_3=0$, but then two zeroes are adjacent, so that doesn't work.
that leaves that the 2nd, 4th and 6th digit are zeros, and the three remaining ($a_1,a_3,a_5$) can be anything but zero.

**Explanation:**
1. Note that since there are 3 non-adjacent zeros, they have to be in places 2, 4, 6 when counted from the left. I.e. the only way a 6-digit number satisfies the condition is if it is of the form $\overline{a0b0c0}$.
2. The remaining 3 digits ($a, b, c$) can be arbitrary with the only condition that $a, b, c$ are not a $0$. Therefore, the total number of such 6-digit numbers is 
\[ 9 \cdot 9 \cdot 9 = 729 \]","Answer is 729.
Solution:
Step 1:
First digit must not be 0, and there are 9 different ways to select it (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). 

Step 2:
We need to select 3 positions of zeros out of five available positions. Since there must be no adjacent zeros, there is only one way to select positions of zeros - second, fourth, and sixth. The reason why is because we must have >= 1 space between zeros and 3 zeros, the number of digits is >= 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 - tight bound, and equality holds if and only if we have non zero - zero - non zero - zero - non zero - zero.

Step 3:
We proved that the third and fifth digits are not zero. Third and fifth digits can have any non-zero values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), so there are 9 * 9 = 81 ways to choose them by product rule. 

Step 4: By product rule, the total number of ways to build a number is 81 * 9 * 1 = 729 because we have 9 ways to select the first digit and 81 ways to select a pair of third and fifth digits, while there is only one way to select the triple of the second, fourth, and sixth digit - (0, 0, 0).",AB,"Pass, Pass, Pass","A, A, A","A, B, A",None,None,"{

Points $D$ and $E$ are choses on its side $BC$ so that $BD=DE=EC=1/3$, and points $F$ is chose on its side $AC$ so that $AF=1/3$. What is the sum of $\angle ADF$ and $\angle AEF$?",probID_Angles_Sum_Classic,"**Answer**: $30^{\circ}$.

There are many ways to prove this, here is one of them:

1. Since $AF = BD$ in an equilateral triangle $ABC$, we must have $DF || AB$. Therefore $\angle ADF = \angle BAD$.

2. Note that $EC = 1/3$, and $FC = AC - AF = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3$, and $\angle ECF = 60^{\circ}$. This implies that $\triangle FEC$ is a right-angled triangle with the $\angle FEC$ being the right one. 

3. Let $AH$ be the altitude of the triangle $ABC$. Then $AH || FE$, which implies that $\angle AEF = \angle HAE$.

4. Finally, putting the steps 1 and 3 together, gives us that 

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","**Answer:** $30^{\circ}$.

Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$, which coincides with the midpoint of $DE$ as $BD = CE$. 

**Step 1.** Notice that $AB \parallel DF$. This is because $\triangle ABC$ is equilateral and $BD = AF = \frac{1}{3}$. Therefore $ABDF$ is an isosceles trapezoid, and so $\angle BAD = \angle ADF$.

**Step 2.** Notice that $AM\parallel EF$ as $\frac{ME}{EC} = \frac{1/6}{1/3} = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{AF}{FC} = \frac{1/3}{2/3} = \frac{1}{2}$, so $AM \parallel EF$ by Thales's theorem. Therefore, $\angle AEF = \angle EAM = \angle DAM$ by symmetry.

let's look at where we can put the zeros.
let's prove we can only put zeroes in the 2nd, 4th and 6th place.
**proof**
$a_1$ can't be zero, since it's the first digit, and numbers can't begin with a zero.
if $a_3=0$, we can't put a zero on the second and fourth spot, because no two zeros are adjacent, so we have to put them in 5th and 6th, but then they'd be adjacent, so $a_3\neq0$.
if $a_5=0$, $a_4\neq0, a_6\neq0$, and because we need 2 more zeroes and have only 2 digits available, $a_2=0$ and $a_3=0$, but then two zeroes are adjacent, so that doesn't work.
**end of proof**
now, we have proven that zeroes can only be in the 2nd, 4th and 6th spot, and since we need 3 zeroes, and three spots are available, that means that the zeroes must be in those places.
that leaves that the 2nd, 4th and 6th digit are zeros, and the three remaining ($a_1,a_3,a_5$) can be anything but zero.

\[ 9 \cdot 9 \cdot 9 = 729 \]","Answer is 729.
Solution:

Step 1:
First digit must not be 0, and there are 9 different ways to select it (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). 

Step 2:
We need to select 3 positions of zeros out of five available positions. Since there must be no adjacent zeros, there is only one way to select positions of zeros - second, fourth, and sixth. The reason why is because we must have >= 1 space between zeros and 3 zeros, the number of digits is >= 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 - tight bound, and equality holds if and only if we have non zero - zero - non zero - zero - non zero - zero.

Step 3:
We proved that the third and fifth digits are not zero. Third and fifth digits can have any non-zero values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), so there are 9 * 9 = 81 ways to choose them by product rule. 

Step 4: By product rule, the total number of ways to build a number is 81 * 9 * 1 = 729 because we have 9 ways to select the first digit and 81 ways to select a pair of third and fifth digits, while there is only one way to select the triple of the second, fourth, and sixth digit - (0, 0, 0).

1. Note that since there are 3 non-adjacent zeros, they have to be in places 2, 4, 6 when counted from the left. I.e. the only way a 6-digit number satisfies the condition is if it is of the form $\overline{a0b0c0}$.

Since we put 0 zeros to our decimal places and our number contains exactly threee zeros, we know that a, b, c are different than 0.

\[ 9 \cdot 9 \cdot 9 = 729 \]","Answer is 729.
Solution:

Step 1:
First digit must not be 0, and there are 9 different ways to select it (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). 

Step 2:
We need to select 3 positions of zeros out of five available positions. Since there must be no adjacent zeros, there is only one way to select positions of zeros - second, fourth, and sixth. The reason why is because we must have at least 1 space between zeros and 3 zeros, the number of digits is at least 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 - which is a tight bound since we have exactly five digits except the first one. The equality holds if and only if we have zero - non zero - zero - non zero - zero as our digits starting from the second one.

Step 3:
We proved that the third and fifth digits are not zero. Third and fifth digits can have any non-zero values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), so there are 9 * 9 = 81 ways to choose them by product rule. 

Step 4: By product rule, the total number of ways to build a number is 81 * 9 * 1 = 729 because we have 9 ways to select the first digit and 81 ways to select a pair of third and fifth digits, while there is only one way to select the triple of the second, fourth, and sixth digit - (0, 0, 0).

Points $D$ and $E$ are choses on its side $BC$ so that $BD=DE=EC=1/3$, and points $F$ is chose on its side $AC$ so that $AF=1/3$. What is the sum of $\angle ADF$ and $\angle AEF$?",probID_Angles_Sum_Classic,"**Answer**: $30^{\circ}$.

There are many ways to prove this, here is one of them:

1. Since $AF = BD$ in an equilateral triangle $ABC$, we must have $DF || AB$. Therefore $\angle ADF = \angle BAD$.

2. Note that $EC = 1/3$, and $FC = AC - AF = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3$, and $\angle ECF = 60^{\circ}$. This implies that $\triangle FEC$ is a right-angled triangle with the $\angle FEC$ being the right one. 

3. Let $AH$ be the altitude of the triangle $ABC$. Then $AH || FE$, which implies that $\angle AEF = \angle HAE$.

4. Finally, putting the steps 1 and 3 together, gives us that 

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","**Answer:** $30^{\circ}$.

Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$, which coincides with the midpoint of $DE$ as $BD = CE$. 

**Step 1.** Note that $\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{1}{2} = \frac{AF}{FC}$, so $AB \parallel DF$ by Thales's theorem. Therefore $\angle BAD = \angle ADF$.

**Step 2.** Notice that $\frac{ME}{EC} = \frac{1/6}{1/3} = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{AF}{FC} = \frac{1/3}{2/3} = \frac{1}{2}$, so $AM \parallel EF$ by Thales's theorem. Since $\triangle ADE$ is isosceles (note that $\triangle ABD \cong \triangle ACE$ by two equal sides $AB = AC$, $CE = \frac{1}{3} = BD$ and a common angle $\angle ABD = 60^{\circ} = \angle ACE$ between them. Thus, the median $AM$ is also an angle bisector due to symmetry, so $\angle AEF = \angle EAM = \angle DAM$.

**Step 3.** Finally, we compute:
\[\angle ADF + \angle AFE = \angle BAD + \angle DAM = \angle BAM = 30^{\circ}.\]
Here, we used that $\angle BAM = \angle CAM$. This follows as $\triangle BAM \cong \triangle CAM$ as $AB = AC = 1$, $BM = CM$ by construction and $\angle ABM = 60^{\circ} = \angle ACM$ from the equilateral triangle $ABC$.

The first digit can't be a zero since we're looking for six-digit numbers. However, since no two consecutive digits are zeros, at most one of the second and third is a zero, at most one of the fourth and fifth digit is a zero.

Hence, as we must have $3$ zeros, the last digit must be a zero. Therefore, the fifth digit isn't a zero. But now two of the second, third and fourth digit must be zeros, and they must not be consecutive. Therefore, the second, fourth, and sixth digit must be zeros.

Points $D$ and $E$ are choses on its side $BC$ so that $BD=DE=EC=1/3$, and points $F$ is chose on its side $AC$ so that $AF=1/3$. What is the sum of $\angle ADF$ and $\angle AEF$?",probID_Angles_Sum_Classic,"**Answer**: $30^{\circ}$.

There are many ways to prove this, here is one of them:

1. Since $AF = BD$ in an equilateral triangle $ABC$, we must have $DF || AB$. Therefore $\angle ADF = \angle BAD$.

2. Note that $EC = 1/3$, and $FC = AC - AF = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3$, and $\angle ECF = 60^{\circ}$. This implies that $\triangle FEC$ is a right-angled triangle with the $\angle FEC$ being the right one. 

3. Let $AH$ be the altitude of the triangle $ABC$. Then $AH || FE$, which implies that $\angle AEF = \angle HAE$.

4. Finally, putting the steps 1 and 3 together, gives us that 

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","**Answer:** $30^{\circ}$.

Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$, which coincides with the midpoint of $DE$ as $BD = CE$. 

**Step 1.** Note that $\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{1}{2} = \frac{AF}{FC}$, so $AB \parallel DF$ by Thales's theorem. Therefore $\angle BAD = \angle ADF$.

**Step 2.** Notice that $\frac{ME}{EC} = \frac{1/6}{1/3} = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{AF}{FC} = \frac{1/3}{2/3} = \frac{1}{2}$, so $AM \parallel EF$ by Thales's theorem. Since $\triangle ADE$ is isosceles (note that $\triangle ABD \cong \triangle ACE$ by two equal sides $AB = AC$, $CE = \frac{1}{3} = BD$ and a common angle $\angle ABD = 60^{\circ} = \angle ACE$ between them. Thus, the median $AM$ is also an angle bisector due to symmetry, so $\angle AEF = \angle EAM = \angle DAM$.

**Step 3.** Finally, we compute:
\[\angle ADF + \angle AFE = \angle BAD + \angle DAM = \angle BAM = 30^{\circ}.\]
Here, we used that $\angle BAM = \angle CAM$. This follows as $\triangle BAM \cong \triangle CAM$ as $AB = AC = 1$, $BM = CM$ by construction and $\angle ABM = 60^{\circ} = \angle ACM$ from the equilateral triangle $ABC$.

**Explanation:** 

**Lemma:**If there are exactly 3 zeros in a decimal representation of a 6-digit number, and there are no adjacent ones, they have to be exactly on positions 2, 4 and 6. (as in the second, fourth and sixth digit in the decimal representation)

**Proof:** Suppose this isn't true. This means that a zero iz on at least one of the 1st, 3rd or 5th position. It obviously cannot be on the first position, because numbers do not begin with a zero. If a zero is on the 3rd position, then there can be a second zero only on the 5th or sixth position, (can't be fourth or second because of the adjacency constriction, and can't be on first because of the aforementioned reason), but not on both of them, since the 5th and sixth place are adjacent. This would mean that there are less than three zeros in the representation, which cannot happen. Similarly, if a zero is on the 5th position, another zero can only be on the second or third position, but not on both of them, resulting in the final number having less than 3 digits 0. This means that all of such numbers have to have digits zero on exactly the second, fourth and sixth position.

Now that we've proved that, it only remains to calculate how many such 6-digit numbers there are. Since the remaining three positions can be taken by any digit besides a zero, there are $9\cdot9\cdot9=729$ digits. This completes the proof",AA,"Pass, Pass, Pass","A, A, A","A, A, A",None,None,"{

Because there are nine ways of choosing the first number because the six digit number cannot start with a zero. There are nine ways of choosing the other numbers in between the zeroes since repetition is allowed.

**Explanation:**
1. Note that since there are 3 non-adjacent zeros, they have to be in places 2, 4, 6 when counted from the left. I.e. the only way a 6-digit number satisfies the condition is if it is of the form $\overline{a0b0c0}$.

mem_cmc7jg74o00090wog9qs03lx6,2025-07-05 10:51:12.282,"There is an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with side legnth $1$. Points $D$ and $E$ are choses on its side $BC$ so that $BD=DE=EC=1/3$, and points $F$ is chose on its side $AC$ so that $AF=1/3$. What is the sum of $\angle ADF$ and $\angle AEF$?",probID_Angles_Sum_Classic,"**Answer**: $30^{\circ}$.

There are many ways to prove this, here is one of them:

1. Since $AF = BD$ in an equilateral triangle $ABC$, we must have $DF || AB$. Therefore $\angle ADF = \angle BAD$.

2. Note that $EC = 1/3$, and $FC = AC - AF = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3$, and $\angle ECF = 60^{\circ}$. This implies that $\triangle FEC$ is a right-angled triangle with the $\angle FEC$ being the right one. 

3. Let $AH$ be the altitude of the triangle $ABC$. Then $AH || FE$, which implies that $\angle AEF = \angle HAE$.

4. Finally, putting the steps 1 and 3 together, gives us that 

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","**Answer:** $30^{\circ}$.

Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$, which coincides with the midpoint of $DE$ as $BD = CE$. 

**Step 1.** Note that $\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{1}{2} = \frac{AF}{FC}$, so $AB \parallel DF$ by Thales's theorem. Therefore $\angle BAD = \angle ADF$.

**Step 2.** Notice that $\frac{MC}{EC} = \frac{1/2}{1/3} = \frac{3}{2}$ and $\frac{AC}{FC} = \frac{1}{2/3} = \frac{3}{2}$ as well, so $AM \parallel EF$ by Thales's theorem. Since $\triangle ADE$ is isosceles (note that $\triangle ABD \cong \triangle ACE$ by two equal sides $AB = AC$, $CE = \frac{1}{3} = BD$ and a common angle $\angle ABD = 60^{\circ} = \angle ACE$ between them. Thus, the median $AM$ is also an angle bisector due to symmetry, so $\angle AEF = \angle EAM = \angle DAM$.

**Step 3.** Finally, we compute:
\[\angle ADF + \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle DAM = \angle BAM = 30^{\circ}.\]
Here, we used that $\angle BAM = \angle CAM$. This follows as $\triangle BAM \cong \triangle CAM$ as $AB = AC = 1$, $BM = CM$ by construction and $\angle ABM = 60^{\circ} = \angle ACM$ from the equilateral triangle $ABC$.

\[ 9 \cdot 9 \cdot 9 = 729 \]","There are 6 positions for each digit. Considering the first digit of a number cannot be zero, you can have C(5;3) ways of choosing a place for each zero. We also have to consider the other 3 spots available, and since the number should contain exactly three zeroes and no more, which means there is  9*9*9=729 ways of choosing the number. Therefore, for every one of the C(5;3) possible zero-patterns, there are 729 possible ways to choose the non-zero digits.
Therefore the total number of six-digit strings that have exactly three zeros (none in the first position) and make no other restrictionsis C(5;3) (ways to place the zeros) × 729 (ways to choose the other digits) = 7 290.
Now I will apply a counter approach where I will find the amount of numbers where 2 zeroes are adjacent, and subtract that amount from the possible ways to choose six-digit numbers contain exactly three zeros in their decimal representation. There is 9*729=6561 numbers with at least at least one pair of adjacent zeros.

mem_cmc7jg74o00090wog9qs03lx6,2025-07-05 10:55:11.197,"There is an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with side legnth $1$. Points $D$ and $E$ are choses on its side $BC$ so that $BD=DE=EC=1/3$, and points $F$ is chose on its side $AC$ so that $AF=1/3$. What is the sum of $\angle ADF$ and $\angle AEF$?",probID_Angles_Sum_Classic,"**Answer**: $30^{\circ}$.

There are many ways to prove this, here is one of them:

1. Since $AF = BD$ in an equilateral triangle $ABC$, we must have $DF || AB$. Therefore $\angle ADF = \angle BAD$.

2. Note that $EC = 1/3$, and $FC = AC - AF = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3$, and $\angle ECF = 60^{\circ}$. This implies that $\triangle FEC$ is a right-angled triangle with the $\angle FEC$ being the right one. 

3. Let $AH$ be the altitude of the triangle $ABC$. Then $AH || FE$, which implies that $\angle AEF = \angle HAE$.

4. Finally, putting the steps 1 and 3 together, gives us that 

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","**Answer:** $30^{\circ}$.

Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$, which coincides with the midpoint of $DE$ as $BD = CE$. 

**Step 1.** Note that $\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{1}{2} = \frac{AF}{FC}$, so $AB \parallel DF$ by Thales's theorem. Therefore $\angle BAD = \angle ADF$.

**Step 2.** Look at $\triangle CFE$ and $\triangle CAM$. Notice that $\frac{MC}{EC} = \frac{1/2}{1/3} = \frac{3}{2}$ and $\frac{AC}{FC} = \frac{1}{2/3} = \frac{3}{2}$. Therefore, by Thales's theorem, we have $AM \parallel EF$, and therefore, $\angle AEF = \angle MAE$ from these parallel lines. 

**Step 3.** Since $\triangle ADE$ is isosceles (note that $\triangle ABD \cong \triangle ACE$ by two equal sides $AB = AC$, $CE = \frac{1}{3} = BD$ and a common angle $\angle ABD = 60^{\circ} = \angle ACE$ between them. Thus, the median $AM$ is also an angle bisector due to symmetry, so $\angle EAM = \angle DAM$. However, from Step 2, $\angle EAM = \angle AEF$, so $\angle AEF = \angle DAM$.

**Step 3.** Finally, we compute:
\[\angle ADF + \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle DAM = \angle BAM = 30^{\circ}.\]
Here, we used that $\angle BAM = \angle CAM$. This follows as $\triangle BAM \cong \triangle CAM$ as $AB = AC = 1$, $BM = CM$ by construction and $\angle ABM = 60^{\circ} = \angle ACM$ from the equilateral triangle $ABC$. This concludes the solution.",-B,"Pass, Pass, Pass","E, B, A","A, B, B",,,"{

**Explanation:**
1. Note that since there are 3 non-adjacent zeros, they have to be in places 2, 4, 6 when counted from the left. I.e. the only way a 6-digit number satisfies the condition is if it is of the form $\overline{a0b0c0}$.

This is because there are 6 spots available and if we want 3 of them to be non adjacent we would need a minimum of 1 spot in between them. This is only possible at 2, 4, 6 and 1, 3, 5. However the number does not begin with zero. Hence, the zeroes occupy the positions 2, 4 and 6. To choose numbers for positions 1, 3 and 5, we have 9 possibilities for each position (excluding zero).

Points $D$ and $E$ are choses on its side $BC$ so that $BD=DE=EC=1/3$, and points $F$ is chose on its side $AC$ so that $AF=1/3$. What is the sum of $\angle ADF$ and $\angle AEF$?",probID_Angles_Sum_Classic,"**Answer**: $30^{\circ}$.

There are many ways to prove this, here is one of them:

1. Since $AF = BD$ in an equilateral triangle $ABC$, we must have $DF || AB$. Therefore $\angle ADF = \angle BAD$.

2. Note that $EC = 1/3$, and $FC = AC - AF = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3$, and $\angle ECF = 60^{\circ}$. This implies that $\triangle FEC$ is a right-angled triangle with the $\angle FEC$ being the right one. 

3. Let $AH$ be the altitude of the triangle $ABC$. Then $AH || FE$, which implies that $\angle AEF = \angle HAE$.

4. Finally, putting the steps 1 and 3 together, gives us that 

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","**Answer:** $30^{\circ}$.

Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$, which coincides with the midpoint of $DE$ as $BD = CE$. 

**Step 1.** Note that $\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{1}{2} = \frac{AF}{FC}$, so $AB \parallel DF$ by Thales's theorem. Therefore $\angle BAD = \angle ADF$.

**Step 2.** Look at $\triangle CFE$ and $\triangle CAM$. Notice that $\frac{MC}{EC} = \frac{1/2}{1/3} = \frac{3}{2}$ and $\frac{AC}{FC} = \frac{1}{2/3} = \frac{3}{2}$. Therefore, $\triangle CFE \sim \triangle CAM$, and from there we have $AM \parallel EF$, and therefore, $\angle AEF = \angle MAE$ from these parallel lines. 

**Step 3.** Since $\triangle ADE$ is isosceles (note that $\triangle ABD \cong \triangle ACE$ by two equal sides $AB = AC$, $CE = \frac{1}{3} = BD$ and a common angle $\angle ABD = 60^{\circ} = \angle ACE$ between them. Thus, the median $AM$ is also an angle bisector due to symmetry, so $\angle EAM = \angle DAM$. However, from Step 2, $\angle EAM = \angle AEF$, so $\angle AEF = \angle DAM$.

**Step 3.** Finally, we compute:
\[\angle ADF + \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle DAM = \angle BAM = 30^{\circ}.\]
Here, we used that $\angle BAM = \angle CAM$. This follows as $\triangle BAM \cong \triangle CAM$ as $AB = AC = 1$, $BM = CM$ by construction and $\angle ABM = 60^{\circ} = \angle ACM$ from the equilateral triangle $ABC$.

What is the sum of $\angle ADF$ and $\angle AEF$?",probID_Angles_Sum_Classic,"**Answer**: $30^{\circ}$.

There are many ways to prove this, here is one of them:

1. Since $AF = BD$ in an equilateral triangle $ABC$, we must have $DF || AB$. Therefore $\angle ADF = \angle BAD$.

2. Note that $EC = 1/3$, and $FC = AC - AF = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3$, and $\angle ECF = 60^{\circ}$. This implies that $\triangle FEC$ is a right-angled triangle with the $\angle FEC$ being the right one. 

3. Let $AH$ be the altitude of the triangle $ABC$. Then $AH || FE$, which implies that $\angle AEF = \angle HAE$.

4. Finally, putting the steps 1 and 3 together, gives us that 

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","**Answer:** $30^{\circ}$.

Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$, which coincides with the midpoint of $DE$ as $BD = CE$. 

**Step 1.** Note that $\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{1}{2} = \frac{AF}{FC}$, so $AB \parallel DF$ by Thales's theorem. Therefore $\angle BAD = \angle ADF$.

**Step 2.** Look at $\triangle CFE$ and $\triangle CAM$. Notice that $\frac{MC}{EC} = \frac{1/2}{1/3} = \frac{3}{2}$ and $\frac{AC}{FC} = \frac{1}{2/3} = \frac{3}{2}$. Therefore, $\triangle CFE \sim \triangle CAM$, and from there we have $AM \parallel EF$, and therefore, $\angle AEF = \angle MAE$ from these parallel lines. 

**Step 3.** Since $\triangle ADE$ is isosceles (note that $\triangle ABD \cong \triangle ACE$ by two equal sides $AB = AC$, $CE = \frac{1}{3} = BD$ and a common angle $\angle ABD = 60^{\circ} = \angle ACE$ between them. Thus, the median $AM$ is also an angle bisector due to symmetry, so $\angle EAM = \angle DAM$. However, from Step 2, $\angle EAM = \angle AEF$, so $\angle AEF = \angle DAM$.

**Step 3.** Finally, we compute:
\[\angle ADF + \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle DAM = \angle BAM = 30^{\circ}.\]
Here, we used that $\angle BAM = \angle CAM$. This follows as $\triangle BAM \cong \triangle CAM$ as $AB = AC = 1$, $BM = CM$ by construction and $\angle ABM = 60^{\circ} = \angle ACM$ from the equilateral triangle $ABC$.

What is the sum of $\angle ADF$ and $\angle AEF$?",probID_Angles_Sum_Classic,"**Answer**: $30^{\circ}$.

There are many ways to prove this, here is one of them:

1. Since $AF = BD$ in an equilateral triangle $ABC$, we must have $DF || AB$. Therefore $\angle ADF = \angle BAD$.

2. Note that $EC = 1/3$, and $FC = AC - AF = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3$, and $\angle ECF = 60^{\circ}$. This implies that $\triangle FEC$ is a right-angled triangle with the $\angle FEC$ being the right one. 

3. Let $AH$ be the altitude of the triangle $ABC$. Then $AH || FE$, which implies that $\angle AEF = \angle HAE$.

4. Finally, putting the steps 1 and 3 together, gives us that 

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","**Answer:** $30^{\circ}$.

Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$, which coincides with the midpoint of $DE$ as $BD = CE$. 

**Step 1.** Note that $\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{1}{2} = \frac{AF}{FC}$, so $AB \parallel DF$ by Thales's theorem. Therefore $\angle BAD = \angle ADF$.

**Step 2.** Look at $\triangle CFE$ and $\triangle CAM$. Notice that $\frac{MC}{EC} = \frac{1/2}{1/3} = \frac{3}{2}$ and $\frac{AC}{FC} = \frac{1}{2/3} = \frac{3}{2}$. Therefore, $\triangle CFE \sim \triangle CAM$, and from there we have $AM \parallel EF$, and therefore, $\angle AEF = \angle MAE$ from these parallel lines. 

**Step 3.** Since $\triangle ADE$ is isosceles (note that $\triangle ABD \cong \triangle ACE$ by two equal sides $AB = AC$, $CE = \frac{1}{3} = BD$ and a common angle $\angle ABD = 60^{\circ} = \angle ACE$ between them. Thus, the median $AM$ is also an angle bisector due to symmetry, so $\angle EAM = \angle DAM$. However, from Step 2, $\angle EAM = \angle AEF$, so $\angle AEF = \angle DAM$.

**Step 4.** Finally, we compute:
\[\angle ADF + \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle DAM = \angle BAM = 30^{\circ}.\]
Here, we used that $\angle BAM = \angle CAM$. This follows as $\triangle BAM \cong \triangle CAM$ as $AB = AC = 1$, $BM = CM$ by construction and $\angle ABM = 60^{\circ} = \angle ACM$ from the equilateral triangle $ABC$.

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","We start with the observation that triangle $ADE$ is isosceles. Note also that because of the symmetry of the problem, the angle $\angle DAE$ is 20 degrees, as it is 1/3 of the total angle $\angle BAC$. 

This tells us that angles $\angle EDA$ and $\angle AED$ must sum to 160 degrees (as together with $\angle DAE$ they sum to 180). Since the triangle is isosceles, they must each be 80 degrees.


Now consider the triangle $DFC$. This is an equilateral triangle, all of its sides have lengths 2/3. Hence the angle $\angle CDF$ must be 60 degrees.

But the angles $\angle CDF$ and $\angle ADF$ sum to 80 degrees, because they combined form the angle $\angle EDA$, so that means $\angle ADF$ must be 20 degrees.

For calculating $\angle AEF$ note that it combined with $\angle AED$ forms the angle $\angle FED$. This is the angle between a bisector of an equilateral triangle and thus must be 90 degrees.

Because $\angle AED$ is 80 degrees, we conclude $\angle AEF$ is 10 degrees.

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","**Answer:** $30^{\circ}$

Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$, which also serves as the midpoint of $DE$, since $BD = CE$.

**Step 1.**
Observe that $\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{1}{2} = \frac{AF}{FC}$. By Thales's Theorem, this implies $AB \parallel DF$. Consequently,
$$
\angle BAD = \angle ADF.
$$

**Step 2.**
Now consider triangles $\triangle CFE$ and $\triangle CAM$. Note that
$$
\frac{MC}{EC} = \frac{1/2}{1/3} = \frac{3}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{AC}{FC} = \frac{1}{2/3} = \frac{3}{2}.
$$
This shows that $\triangle CFE \sim \triangle CAM$ by SAS similarity. From the similarity, it follows that $AM \parallel EF$, and therefore:
$$
\angle AEF = \angle MAE.
$$

**Step 3.**
The triangle $\triangle ADE$ is isosceles. To justify this, observe that $\triangle ABD \cong \triangle ACE$ because:

* $AB = AC = 1$,
* $BD = CE = \frac{1}{3}$, and
* $\angle ABD = \angle ACE = 60^\circ$ (from equilateral triangle $ABC$).

Thus, by SAS congruence, the triangles are congruent. It follows by symmetry that median $AM$ of $\triangle ABC$ is also the angle bisector of $\angle DAE$, so:

$$
\angle EAM = \angle DAM.
$$

From Step 2, $\angle EAM = \angle AEF$, so we conclude:

$$
\angle AEF = \angle DAM.
$$

**Step 4.**
Finally, compute the desired angle:

$$
\angle ADF + \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle DAM = \angle BAM.
$$

Now, since $\triangle BAM \cong \triangle CAM$, we have $\angle BAM = \angle CAM$. This congruence holds because:

* $AB = AC = 1$,
* $BM = CM$ (as $M$ is the midpoint), and
* $\angle ABM = \angle ACM = 60^\circ$ (from equilateral $\triangle ABC$).

Hence, $\angle BAM = 30^\circ$ as desired.",AB,"Pass, Pass, Pass","A, A, A","A, B, B",None,None,"{

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","**Answer:** $30^{\circ}$

Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$, which also serves as the midpoint of $DE$, since $BD = CE$.

**Step 1.**
Observe that $\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{1}{2} = \frac{AF}{FC}$. By Thales's Theorem, this implies $AB \parallel DF$. Consequently,
$$
\angle BAD = \angle ADF.
$$

**Step 2.**
Now consider triangles $\triangle CFE$ and $\triangle CAM$. Note that
$$
\frac{MC}{EC} = \frac{1/2}{1/3} = \frac{3}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{AC}{FC} = \frac{1}{2/3} = \frac{3}{2}.
$$
This shows that $\triangle CFE \sim \triangle CAM$ by SAS similarity as $\angle ECF = 60^{\circ} = \angle MCA$. From the similarity, it follows that $AM \parallel EF$, and therefore:
$$
\angle AEF = \angle MAE.
$$

**Step 3.**
The triangle $\triangle ADE$ is isosceles. To justify this, observe that $\triangle ABD \cong \triangle ACE$ because:

* $AB = AC = 1$,
* $BD = CE = \frac{1}{3}$, and
* $\angle ABD = \angle ACE = 60^\circ$ (from equilateral triangle $ABC$).

Thus, by SAS congruence, the triangles are congruent. Therefore, $AD = AE$, so $\triangle ADE$ is iscosceles. It follows by symmetry that median $AM$ of $\triangle ABC$ is also the angle bisector of $\angle DAE$, so:

$$
\angle EAM = \angle DAM.
$$

From Step 2, $\angle EAM = \angle AEF$, so we conclude:

$$
\angle AEF = \angle DAM.
$$

**Step 4.**
Finally, compute the desired angle:

$$
\angle ADF + \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle DAM = \angle BAM.
$$

Now, since $\triangle BAM \cong \triangle CAM$, we have $\angle BAM = \angle CAM$. This congruence holds because:

* $AB = AC = 1$,
* $BM = CM$ (as $M$ is the midpoint), and
* $\angle ABM = \angle ACM = 60^\circ$ (from equilateral $\triangle ABC$).

Now, let's note a few things:

1. We know that $a + b + c = 1 + 2 + 3 \text{ (in some order)} = 6$ 
2. And we know that $a \times b$, $a \times c$ and $b \times c$ are, in some order, $2$, $3$ and $6$. Thus,
\[ (a \times b) + (a \times c) + (b \times c) = 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 \]

Therefore, if we write \[ a + b + c + a + b + c - ((a \times b) + (a \times c) + (b \times c)) \] we will always get $6 + 6 - 11 = 1$.","For ease of writing the solution we call these symbols $a,b,c$ respectively. 

We first give the plan. We are going to find a way to make 49, 11 and 6, using expressions that are invariant under reassignment of the values of $a,b,c$ to each other, i.e. they are cyclically invariant. There is no particular reason for choosing these 49, 11 and 6, others may work, but these are the ones I came up with quickest that generate a solution.

We will then combine these, since $6 + 11 + 11 + 11 + 11 - 49 = 1$, which is the answer we wish to produce.

To produce six, note that $abc$ has this cyclical invariance and hence is definitely 6, independent of the assignment of $a,b,c$ as long as one of them is 1, one is 2 and one is 3.

To produce 11, we consider the cyclic expression $ab + ac + bc$. This must be $(1\cdot 2) + (1 \cdot 3) + (2 \cdot 3) = 2 + 3 + 6 = 11$.

To produce 49, we square the individual terms in the last sum, i.e. we take 
$aabb + aacc + bbcc$. This must be $2^2 + 3^2 + 6^2$ and so is equal to 49.

We then combine them as we described in advance to give the final expression:

$abc + ab + bc + ac + ab + bc + ac + ab + bc + ac + ab + bc + ac - (aabb + aacc + bbcc)$. By the reasoning above, this is 6 + 44 - 49, which is 1 as required.",AB,"Pass, Pass, Pass","A, A, A","B, B, B",None,None,"{

Points $D$ and $E$ are choses on its side $BC$ so that $BD=DE=EC=1/3$, and points $F$ is chose on its side $AC$ so that $AF=1/3$. What is the sum of $\angle ADF$ and $\angle AEF$?",probID_Angles_Sum_Classic,"**Answer**: $30^{\circ}$.

There are many ways to prove this, here is one of them:

1. Since $AF = BD$ in an equilateral triangle $ABC$, we must have $DF || AB$. Therefore $\angle ADF = \angle BAD$.

2. Note that $EC = 1/3$, and $FC = AC - AF = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3$, and $\angle ECF = 60^{\circ}$. This implies that $\triangle FEC$ is a right-angled triangle with the $\angle FEC$ being the right one. 

3. Let $AH$ be the altitude of the triangle $ABC$. Then $AH || FE$, which implies that $\angle AEF = \angle HAE$.

4. Finally, putting the steps 1 and 3 together, gives us that 

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","**Answer:** $30^\circ$
**Proof:**
First, let's notice that $\angle{ADB}+\angle{ADF}+\angle{FDC} = 180^\circ$ and that $\angle{AEB} + \angle{AEF} + \angle{FEC} = 180^\circ$. To find the sum $\angle{ADF} + \angle{AEF}$ we just need to find all other angles mentioned in the formulas above. Label $\angle{ADF} = \alpha$ and $\angle{AEF} = \beta$
1) Let's notice that $\angle{FDC} = 60^\circ$ since triangle $FDC$ is a scaled down version of triangle $ABC$ with a factor of $\frac23$ which is an equilateral triangle.
2) Let's notice that triangle $ADE$ is isosceles. From that, we get $\angle{AED}=\angle{ADE}=\angle{ADF}+\angle{FDC}=\alpha+60^\circ$
3) Label $M$ as the midpoint of $BC$, so $AM \perp BC$. Then, since $CE=\frac13$ and $CM=\frac12$ we get $\frac{CE}{CM} = \frac23$. We also know $CF=\frac23$ and $CA=1$, which means $\frac{CF}{CA} = \frac23$. This means by Thales' theorem that triangles $CEF$ and $CMA$ are similar. Thus, $\angle{FEC}=\angle{AMC}=90^\circ$.
4) Let's take a look at the equation $\angle{AEB} + \angle{AEF} + \angle{FEC} = 180^\circ$ again. It is equivalent to $\alpha + 60^\circ + \beta + 90^\circ = 180^\circ$ which means $\alpha + \beta = 180^\circ - 60^\circ - 90^\circ = 30^\circ$ which concludes the proof.",BB,"Pass, Pass, Pass","B, B, B","E, B, B",None,"1.

for any $a, b$. So, let's consider the inverses of the given 101 numbers, which will all belong to the interval $[1/2, 1]$, and suppose they are $1/2 \leq x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_{101} \leq 1$. Then, all we need to show that there must be two numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that

\[ \frac{1}{|x_i - x_j|} \geq 200 \]

\[ |x_i - x_j| \leq 1/200 \]

Points $D$ and $E$ are choses on its side $BC$ so that $BD=DE=EC=1/3$, and points $F$ is chose on its side $AC$ so that $AF=1/3$. What is the sum of $\angle ADF$ and $\angle AEF$?",probID_Angles_Sum_Classic,"**Answer**: $30^{\circ}$.

There are many ways to prove this, here is one of them:

1. Since $AF = BD$ in an equilateral triangle $ABC$, we must have $DF || AB$. Therefore $\angle ADF = \angle BAD$.

2. Note that $EC = 1/3$, and $FC = AC - AF = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3$, and $\angle ECF = 60^{\circ}$. This implies that $\triangle FEC$ is a right-angled triangle with the $\angle FEC$ being the right one. 

3. Let $AH$ be the altitude of the triangle $ABC$. Then $AH || FE$, which implies that $\angle AEF = \angle HAE$.

4. Finally, putting the steps 1 and 3 together, gives us that 

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","1st step:
The answer is $30^\circ$.
2nd step:
Take a point G on the segment $AB$ such that $AF=AG$.
3rd step:
Since ABC is an equilateral triangle, we know that $FC=DC$. So since we know that $FCD=60\circ$ DFC is an equilateral triangle as well. 
4th step:
Since DFC is an equilateral triangle and FE is a median, FE is perpendicular to DC. We also know that since ABC is an equilateral triangle, F and G is symmetrical points, D and E are symmetrical points. Because $AF=AG$, F is on AC , G is on AB; $BD=EC$  they are both between B and C.
5th:
This gives us GD is also perpendicular to BC and $\angle AEF= \angle GDA$. Because this symmetry gives us that AEF and ADG triangles are similar. So $\angle ADF+\angle AEF=\angle GDF$
6th step:
Since $AF=AG$, GF is parallel to BC. Connecting it with perpendicularity of GD and EF with BC gives us that GDEF is a rectangle.
7th:
Since GDEF is a rectangle, $\angle GDF=90-\angle GFD$. Since GF is parallel to BC and FDC is an equilateral triangle, we get that $\ GFD=60^\circ$. So $\angle GDF=30^\circ$.

Prove that among them there is pair $(a,b)$ such that $\frac{ab}{|a-b|} \geq 200$.",probID_Inequality_for_Some_Pair,"The key idea is that \[ \frac{ab}{|a-b|} = \frac{1}{|1/a - 1/b|} \] 

for any $a, b$. So, let's consider the inverses of the given 101 numbers, which will all belong to the interval $[1/2, 1]$, and suppose they are $1/2 \leq x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_{101} \leq 1$. Then, all we need to show that there must be two numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that

\[ \frac{1}{|x_i - x_j|} \geq 200 \]

which is equivalent to 

\[ |x_i - x_j| \leq 1/200 \]

Suppose this is not true, i.e no such $i$ and $j$ exist. But then we must have that $x_{i+1} - x_i > 1/200$ for every $i=1,2,...,100$. Summing these up all over all of the $i = 1,2,...,100$ we will then have that 

\[ x_{101} - x_1  = (x_2 - x_1) + (x_3 - x_2) + ... + (x_{101} - x_{100}) > 100 \cdot 1/200 = 1/2\]

Which is impossible since $x_{101}, x_1$ belong to $[1/2, 1]$, i.e. distance between them is at most $1/2$. This contradiction finishes the proof.","Proof by contradiction:
Assume we have 101 different real numbers 1 <= a(0) < a(1) < a(2) < ...< a(100) <= 2 such that for every i < j we have a(i) * a(j) / |a(i) - a(j)| < 200. 

Step 1:
Since i < j and monotonicity we have |a(i) - a(j)| = a(j) - a(i). Hence, for every i < j we have a(i) * a(j) < 200 * a(j) - 200 * a(i).

Step 2:
For i < j we have 1 < a(i) * a(j) because a(i) is at least 1, and a(j) is strictly greater than a(i) by our initial assumption.

Step 3:
For i < j we have a(j) - a(i) > a(i) * a(j) / 200 > 1 / 200 = 0.005 by steps 1 and 2.

Step 4:
If we apply step 3 to adjacent numbers we get a(i + 1) > a(i) + 0.005. If we apply it n times we get a(n) >= 1 + 0.005 * n.

Step 5:
After applying steps 1 and 4 for j = i + 1 we get 200 * a(i + 1) - 200 * a(i) > a(i) * a(i + 1) >= (1 + 0.005 * i) * (1.005 + 0.005 * i) = 1.005 + 0.010025 * i + 0.000025 * i^2, or
a(i + 1) > a(i) + 0.005025 + 0.000050125 * i + 0.000000125 * i^2.

Step 6:
If we sum step 5 n times we get a(n) >= 1 + 0.005025 * n + 0.000050125 * n * (n + 1) + 0.000000125 * n * (n + 1) * (2*n + 1) / 6 > 1 + 0.005 * n + 0.00005 * n^2

Step 7:
If we apply step 6 for n = 100 we get a(100) > 1 + 0.005 * 100 + 0.00005 * 100 * 100 = 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 2 which contradicts the initial assumption of a(i) <= 2.

Hence, there are i < j such that a(i) * a(j) / |a(i) - a(j)| >= 200.",BB,"Pass, Pass, Pass","E, A, A","A, B, B",None,None / None that won't hint towards a correct solution,"{

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","**Answer:** $30^\circ$
**Proof:**
First, let's notice that $\angle{ADB}+\angle{ADF}+\angle{FDC} = 180^\circ$ and that $\angle{AEB} + \angle{AEF} + \angle{FEC} = 180^\circ$. To find the sum $\angle{ADF} + \angle{AEF}$ we just need to find all other angles mentioned in the formulas above. Label $\angle{ADF} = \alpha$ and $\angle{AEF} = \beta$
1) Let's notice that $\angle{FDC} = 60^\circ$ since triangle $FDC$ is a scaled down version of triangle $ABC$ with a factor of $\frac23$ which is an equilateral triangle.
2) Let's notice that triangle $ADE$ is isosceles with $AD = AE$. This is due to triangles $ABD$ and $ACE$ being congruent by side-angle-side ($AB=AC=1$, $\angle{ABD}=\angle{ACE}=60^\circ$ and $BD=CE=\frac13$) From that, we get $\angle{AED}=\angle{ADE}=\angle{ADF}+\angle{FDC}=\alpha+60^\circ$
3) Label $M$ as the midpoint of $BC$, so $AM \perp BC$. Then, since $CE=\frac13$ and $CM=\frac12$ we get $\frac{CE}{CM} = \frac23$. We also know $CF=\frac23$ and $CA=1$, which means $\frac{CF}{CA} = \frac23$. This, since both triangles contain the point $C$, means by Thales' theorem that triangles $CEF$ and $CMA$ are similar. Thus, $\angle{FEC}=\angle{AMC}=90^\circ$.
4) Let's take a look at the equation $\angle{AEB} + \angle{AEF} + \angle{FEC} = 180^\circ$ again. Since we have previously proven $\angle{AEB} = \angle{AED} = \alpha + 60^\circ$, the equation is equivalent to $\alpha + 60^\circ + \beta + 90^\circ = 180^\circ$ which means $\alpha + \beta = 180^\circ - 60^\circ - 90^\circ = 30^\circ$ which concludes the proof.",-B,"Pass, Pass, Pass","A, F, E","B, B, B",,,"{

mem_clv2kp0ns21k80sozh30b8aug,2025-07-05 11:23:42.178,"There is an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with side legnth $1$. Points $D$ and $E$ are choses on its side $BC$ so that $BD=DE=EC=1/3$, and points $F$ is chose on its side $AC$ so that $AF=1/3$. What is the sum of $\angle ADF$ and $\angle AEF$?",probID_Angles_Sum_Classic,"**Answer**: $30^{\circ}$.

There are many ways to prove this, here is one of them:

1. Since $AF = BD$ in an equilateral triangle $ABC$, we must have $DF || AB$. Therefore $\angle ADF = \angle BAD$.

2. Note that $EC = 1/3$, and $FC = AC - AF = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3$, and $\angle ECF = 60^{\circ}$. This implies that $\triangle FEC$ is a right-angled triangle with the $\angle FEC$ being the right one. 

3. Let $AH$ be the altitude of the triangle $ABC$. Then $AH || FE$, which implies that $\angle AEF = \angle HAE$.

4. Finally, putting the steps 1 and 3 together, gives us that 

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","**Answer:** $30^\circ$
**Proof:**
First, let's notice that $\angle{ADB}+\angle{ADF}+\angle{FDC} = 180^\circ$ and that $\angle{AEB} + \angle{AEF} + \angle{FEC} = 180^\circ$. To find the sum $\angle{ADF} + \angle{AEF}$ we just need to find all other angles mentioned in the formulas above. Label $\angle{ADF} = \alpha$ and $\angle{AEF} = \beta$
1) Let's notice that $\angle{FDC} = 60^\circ$ since triangle $FDC$ is a scaled down version of triangle $ABC$ with a factor of $\frac23$ which is an equilateral triangle.
2) Let's notice that triangle $ADE$ is isosceles with $AD = AE$. This is due to triangles $ABD$ and $ACE$ being congruent by side-angle-side ($AB=AC=1$, $\angle{ABD}=\angle{ACE}=60^\circ$ and $BD=CE=\frac13$) From that, we get $\angle{AED}=\angle{ADE}=\angle{ADF}+\angle{FDC}=\alpha+60^\circ$
3) Label $M$ as the midpoint of $BC$, so $AM \perp BC$. Then, since $CE=\frac13$ and $CM=\frac12$ we get $\frac{CE}{CM} = \frac23$. We also know $CF=\frac23$ and $CA=1$, which means $\frac{CF}{CA} = \frac23$. This, since both triangles contain the point $C$, means by Thales' theorem that triangles $CEF$ and $CMA$ are similar. Thus, $\angle{FEC}=\angle{AMC}=90^\circ$.
4) Let's take a look at the equation $\angle{AEB} + \angle{AEF} + \angle{FEC} = 180^\circ$ again. We know that $\angle{AEB} = \angle{AED}$ due to collinearity of B and D. Thus, we get $\angle{AEB} = \angle{AED} = \alpha + 60^\circ$, so the equation is equivalent to $\alpha + 60^\circ + \beta + 90^\circ = 180^\circ$ which means $\alpha + \beta = 180^\circ - 60^\circ - 90^\circ = 30^\circ$ which concludes the proof.",-B,"Pass, Pass, Pass","F, A, B","A, B, B",,,"{

Prove that among them there is pair $(a,b)$ such that $\frac{ab}{|a-b|} \geq 200$.",probID_Inequality_for_Some_Pair,"The key idea is that \[ \frac{ab}{|a-b|} = \frac{1}{|1/a - 1/b|} \] 

for any $a, b$. So, let's consider the inverses of the given 101 numbers, which will all belong to the interval $[1/2, 1]$, and suppose they are $1/2 \leq x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_{101} \leq 1$. Then, all we need to show that there must be two numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that

\[ \frac{1}{|x_i - x_j|} \geq 200 \]

which is equivalent to 

\[ |x_i - x_j| \leq 1/200 \]

Suppose this is not true, i.e no such $i$ and $j$ exist. But then we must have that $x_{i+1} - x_i > 1/200$ for every $i=1,2,...,100$. Summing these up all over all of the $i = 1,2,...,100$ we will then have that

Let this expression be denoted as 1/k for now, where k = (1/a) - (1/b).

It is given in the question that there are 101 numbers that lie in the range [1,2], thus their reciprocals lie in the range [1/2,1]. 
By pigeonhole principle we know that at least two of these reciprocals differ by less than (1/2)*(1/100) = 1/200.

There are many ways to prove this, here is one of them:

1. Since $AF = BD$ in an equilateral triangle $ABC$, we must have $DF || AB$. Therefore $\angle ADF = \angle BAD$.

2. Note that $EC = 1/3$, and $FC = AC - AF = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3$, and $\angle ECF = 60^{\circ}$. This implies that $\triangle FEC$ is a right-angled triangle with the $\angle FEC$ being the right one. 

3. Let $AH$ be the altitude of the triangle $ABC$. Then $AH || FE$, which implies that $\angle AEF = \angle HAE$.

4. Finally, putting the steps 1 and 3 together, gives us that 

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$.

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","**Answer:** $30^\circ$
**Proof:**
First, let's notice that $\angle{ADB}+\angle{ADF}+\angle{FDC} = 180^\circ$ and that $\angle{AEB} + \angle{AEF} + \angle{FEC} = 180^\circ$. To find the sum $\angle{ADF} + \angle{AEF}$ we just need to find all other angles mentioned in the formulas above. Label $\angle{ADF} = \alpha$ and $\angle{AEF} = \beta$
1) Let's notice that $\angle{FDC} = 60^\circ$ since triangle $FDC$ is equilateral because of $\angle{FCD} = 60^\circ$, $CF = AC-AF=1-\frac13=\frac23$ and $CD=\frac23$.
2) Let's notice that triangle $ADE$ is isosceles with $AD = AE$. This is due to triangles $ABD$ and $ACE$ being congruent by side-angle-side ($AB=AC=1$, $\angle{ABD}=\angle{ACE}=60^\circ$ and $BD=CE=\frac13$). We also know that $\angle{FDE} = \angle{FDC}$ due to collinearity of C and E. From that, we get $\angle{AED}=\angle{ADE}=\angle{ADF}+\angle{FDC}=\alpha+60^\circ$
3) Label $M$ as the midpoint of $BC$, so $AM \perp BC$. Then, since $CE=\frac13$ and $CM=\frac12$ we get $\frac{CE}{CM} = \frac23$. We also know $CF=\frac23$ and $CA=1$, which means $\frac{CF}{CA} = \frac23$. This, since $\frac{CE}{CM}=\frac{CF}{CA}=\frac23$ and $\angle{ACM} = \angle{FCE}$, means by Thales' theorem that triangles $CEF$ and $CMA$ are similar. Thus, $\angle{FEC}=\angle{AMC}=90^\circ$.
4) Let's take a look at the equation $\angle{AEB} + \angle{AEF} + \angle{FEC} = 180^\circ$ again. We know that $\angle{AEB} = \angle{AED}$ due to collinearity of B and D. Thus, we get $\angle{AEB} = \angle{AED} = \alpha + 60^\circ$, so the equation is equivalent to $\alpha + 60^\circ + \beta + 90^\circ = 180^\circ$ which means $\alpha + \beta = 180^\circ - 60^\circ - 90^\circ = 30^\circ$ which concludes the proof.",AB,"Pass, Pass, Pass","A, A, A","B, B, B",None,None,"{

Prove that among them there is pair $(a,b)$ such that $\frac{ab}{|a-b|} \geq 200$.",probID_Inequality_for_Some_Pair,"The key idea is that \[ \frac{ab}{|a-b|} = \frac{1}{|1/a - 1/b|} \] 

for any $a, b$. So, let's consider the inverses of the given 101 numbers, which will all belong to the interval $[1/2, 1]$, and suppose they are $1/2 \leq x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_{101} \leq 1$. Then, all we need to show that there must be two numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that

\[ \frac{1}{|x_i - x_j|} \geq 200 \]

which is equivalent to 

\[ |x_i - x_j| \leq 1/200 \]

Suppose this is not true, i.e no such $i$ and $j$ exist. But then we must have that $x_{i+1} - x_i > 1/200$ for every $i=1,2,...,100$. Summing these up all over all of the $i = 1,2,...,100$ we will then have that 

\[ x_{101} - x_1  = (x_2 - x_1) + (x_3 - x_2) + ... + (x_{101} - x_{100}) > 100 \cdot 1/200 = 1/2\]

Which is impossible since $x_{101}, x_1$ belong to $[1/2, 1]$, i.e. distance between them is at most $1/2$. This contradiction finishes the proof.","Proof by contradiction:
Assume we have 101 different real numbers 1 <= a(0) < a(1) < a(2) < ...< a(100) <= 2 such that for every i < j we have a(i) * a(j) / |a(i) - a(j)| < 200. 

Step 1:
Since i < j and monotonicity we have |a(i) - a(j)| = a(j) - a(i). Hence, for every i < j we have a(i) * a(j) < 200 * a(j) - 200 * a(i).

Step 2:
For i < j we have 1 < a(i) * a(j) because a(i) is at least 1, and a(j) is strictly greater than a(i) by our initial assumption.

Step 3:
For i < j we have a(j) - a(i) > a(i) * a(j) / 200 > 1 / 200 = 0.005 by steps 1 and 2.

Step 4:
If we apply step 3 to adjacent numbers we get a(i + 1) > a(i) + 0.005. If we apply it n times we get a(n) >= 1 + 0.005 * n.

Step 5:
After applying steps 1 and 4 for adjacent numbers a(i + 1) and a(i) we get 200 * a(i + 1) - 200 * a(i) > a(i) * a(i + 1) >= (1 + 0.005 * i) * (1.005 + 0.005 * i) = 1.005 + 0.05 * i * (1 + 1.005) + 0.005^2 * i^2 = 1.005 + 0.010025 * i + 0.000025 * i^2, or equivalently
a(i + 1) > a(i) + 0.005025 + 0.000050125 * i + 0.000000125 * i^2 after we do numerical computations.

Step 6:
If we sum step 5 n times we get a(n) >= 1 + 0.005025 * n + 0.000050125 * n * (n - 1) / 2 + 0.000000125 * n * (n - 1) * (2*n - 1) / 6 because sum of 0 + 1 + ... + (n - 1) = n * (n - 1) / 2 and sum of 0^2 + 1^2 + ... + (n - 1)^2 = n * (n - 1) * (2*n - 1) / 6.

Step 7:
If we apply step 6 for n = 100 we get a(100) >= 1 + 0.005025 * 100 + 0.000050125 * 100 * 99 / 2 + 0.000000125 + 100 * 99 * 199 / 6 > 2 - contradiction.

mem_cmc7jg74o00090wog9qs03lx6,2025-07-05 11:32:19.116,"There is a box, that contains 1 white ball and 99 black balls. At each step, two balls are drawn at random (one with each of the hands, without looking), and the ball in the left hand is recoloured to match the colour of the ball in the right hand. Both balls are then returned to the box. Find the expected number of steps required until all balls in the box are the same color.",probID_99-1_Balls_Recolouring,"**Answer:** $99 \sum_{k=1}^{99} \frac{1}{k}$.

Let \( \tau_k \) denote the expected number of steps to reach this state (all balls the same color), starting from a state with \( k \) white balls and \( 100 - k \) black balls. Clearly, \( \tau_0 = \tau_{100} = 0 \). If \( 0 < k < 100 \), then on the first step a recoloring to white happens with probability

\[
p_k = \frac{k(100 - k)}{99 \cdot 100},
\]

and with the same probability a recoloring to black occurs. So we have:

\[
\tau_k = 1 + p_k (\tau_{k-1} + \tau_{k+1}) + (1 - 2p_k)\tau_k,
\]

\[
2p_k \tau_k = 1 + p_k(\tau_{k-1} + \tau_{k+1}), \quad k = 1, \ldots, 99,
\]

\[
\tau_k = \frac{1}{2p_k} + \frac{1}{2}(\tau_{k-1} + \tau_{k+1}), \quad k = 1, \ldots, 99.
\]

Now, sum over all \( k \) from 1 to 99:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{99} \tau_k = \sum_{k=1}^{99} \frac{1}{2p_k} + \frac{1}{2} \left( \sum_{k=1}^{98} \tau_k + \sum_{k=2}^{99} \tau_k \right).
\]

After simplification, the left side becomes:

\[
\tau_1 + \tau_{99} = \sum_{k=1}^{99} \frac{1}{p_k}.
\]

Due to symmetry between white and black balls, we focus on computing \( \tau_1 \):

\[
\tau_1 = \sum_{k=1}^{99} \frac{1}{2p_k} 
= 99 \cdot 50 \cdot \sum_{k=1}^{99} \frac{1}{100} \left( \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{100 - k} \right).
\]

Simplifying it gives: 
\[
\textbf{Answer: } 99 \sum_{k=1}^{99} \frac{1}{k}.
\]
","**Answer:** $ -\frac{100\cdot 99}{50^2} + \sum\limits_{k=51}^{99} \frac{100\cdot 99}{k(100-k)}$.

At any point, there are $k$ black balls and $100-k$ white balls in the urn. Let's call this position $P_k$ and the expected number of steps required until all the balls are of one color: $E_k$. Clearly, $E_{k} = E_{100-k}$ due to symmetry because we don't care which color has $k$ balls, and which has $100 - k$. Also, clearly $E_0 = E_{100} = 0$.

We will construct a recurrence relation to compute $E_k$. If we have $99$ black balls
* both balls are the same color with probability $\frac{99\cdot 98}{100 \cdot 99} = \frac{98}{100} = \frac{49}{50}$, and nothing changes. 
* With probability $\frac{1\cdot 99}{100\cdot 99}$, the ball in the left hand is white and gets recolored to black, finishing the game.
* With probability $\frac{99 \cdot 1}{100\cdot 99} = \frac{1}{100}$, the right ball is white, and we have $2$ white balls now.

Hence, $E_{99} = 1 + \left(\frac{49}{50}\cdot E_{99} + \frac{1}{100}\cdot E_{100} + \frac{1}{100}\cdot E_{98}\right)$. Subtracting $\frac{49}{50}E_{99}$ from both sides, we get
\[2E_{99} = 100 + E_{100} + E_{98} = E_{98} + 100.\]
Similarly, if we have $k$ black balls, we have:
* a probability of $\frac{k\cdot (100-k)}{100\cdot 99}$ for the ball in our left hand to be black, and the one in the right to be white.
* a probability of $\frac{(100-k)\cdot k}{100\cdot 99}$ for the ball in our left hand to be white and the one in our right hand to be black.
* a probability of $1 - 2\cdot \frac{k(100-k)}{100\cdot 99}$ for the balls to be of the same color, so nothing changes.

Therefore:
\[E_k = 1 + \left(\frac{k\cdot (100-k)}{100\cdot 99}\cdot E_{k-1} + \frac{k\cdot (100-k)}{100\cdot 99}E_{k+1} + \left(1- 2\cdot \frac{k\cdot (100-k)}{100\cdot 99}\right)\cdot E_k\right).\]
After subtracting the $\frac{k\cdot (100-k)}{100\cdot 99}\cdot E_k$ from both sides and multiplying by $\frac{100\cdot 99}{k\cdot (100-k)}$, this is equivalent to
\[2E_k = \frac{100 \cdot 99}{k(100-k)} + E_{k+1} + E_{k-1}.\]
From here, $2E_{50} = \frac{100\cdot 99}{50^2} + E_{49} + E_{51} = \frac{100\cdot 99}{50^2} + 2E_{51}$. Hence 
\[E_{50} - E_{51} = \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{100\cdot 99}{50^2}.\]
From there, since the above equation we got is also equivalent to:
\[E_{k+1} - E_k = E_{k} - E_{k-1} - \frac{100\cdot 99}{k(100-k)}\]
we get that
\[E_{52} - E_{51} = E_{51} - E_{50} - \frac{100\cdot 99}{51\cdot 49} = \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{100\cdot 99}{50^2} - \frac{100\cdot 99}{51\cdot 49}.\]
Continuing similarly, by induction, we get that:
\[E_{100} - E_{99} = E_{99} - E_{98} - \frac{100\cdot 99}{99\cdot 1} = \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{100\cdot 99}{50^2} - \sum\limits_{k=51}^{99} \frac{100\cdot 99}{k(100-k)}.\]
From here, since $E_{100} = 0$, we have:
\[E_{99} = -\frac{100\cdot 99}{50^2} + \sum\limits_{k=51}^{99} \frac{100\cdot 99}{k(100-k)}.\]",EB,"Pass, Pass, Pass","E, E, E","B, B, B","1.

Since they are 1, 2 and 3 in some order, and here the order doesn't matter, we can see that $x=1+2+3=6$ and $y=2+3+6=11$.
Now we will get 1 by using x and y, and performing operations on them.
By doing this, Tamara can simply plug in the values of x and y expressed with the symbols, and obtain 1. 
We can get 1 by using x and y in the following way:
**$x+x-y=12-11=1$**
By turning this into symbols, it is:

**Answer:**$Ⰰ+ב+௩+Ⰰ+ב+௩-(Ⰰ*ב+௩*ב+Ⰰ*௩)$

mem_clvcylmm2032g0snygfkjexm4,2025-07-05 11:35:48.091,"There are $101$ different real numbers chosen from the interval $[1,2]$. Prove that among them there is pair $(a,b)$ such that $\frac{ab}{|a-b|} \geq 200$.",probID_Inequality_for_Some_Pair,"The key idea is that \[ \frac{ab}{|a-b|} = \frac{1}{|1/a - 1/b|} \] 

for any $a, b$. So, let's consider the inverses of the given 101 numbers, which will all belong to the interval $[1/2, 1]$, and suppose they are $1/2 \leq x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_{101} \leq 1$. Then, all we need to show that there must be two numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that

\[ \frac{1}{|x_i - x_j|} \geq 200 \]

which is equivalent to 

\[ |x_i - x_j| \leq 1/200 \]

Suppose this is not true, i.e no such $i$ and $j$ exist. But then we must have that $x_{i+1} - x_i > 1/200$ for every $i=1,2,...,100$. Summing these up all over all of the $i = 1,2,...,100$ we will then have that 

\[ x_{101} - x_1  = (x_2 - x_1) + (x_3 - x_2) + ... + (x_{101} - x_{100}) > 100 \cdot 1/200 = 1/2\]

Which is impossible since $x_{101}, x_1$ belong to $[1/2, 1]$, i.e. distance between them is at most $1/2$. This contradiction finishes the proof.","**Solution:** 

Split the segment $[1,2]$ into 100 smaller segments in the following manner:
$[\frac{200}{200},\frac{200}{199}],[\frac{200}{199},\frac{200}{198}],...,[\frac{200}{i},\frac{200}{i-1}],...,[\frac{200}{101},\frac{200}{100}]$.

**Lemma:** If any two numbers are from the same segment, they satisfy the given condition.

**Proof:** Let $a$ and $b$ be numbers such that $\frac{200}{i}\le a\le b\le \frac{200}{i-1}$, and $101\le i \le 200$. Since $b>a$ the problem condition can be transformed to $b\le\frac{200a}{200-a}$. To prove this, let's take a look at the function $\frac{200x}{200-x}$. The derivative is $\frac{40000}{(200-x)^2}$, which means it is increasing on the entirety of its interval. The minimum value of $\frac{200a}{200-a}$ is reached for the left endpoint of the interval when $a$ is exactly $\frac{200}{i}$. Since $\frac{200\cdot\frac{200}{i}}{200-\frac{200}{i}}=\frac{200}{i-1}$, we have $\frac{200a}{200-a}\ge\frac{200}{i-1}\ge b$. This completes the proof for the lemma.

Now, since we have 101 different real numbers and 100 segments, by pigeonhole principle, at least 2 of them will be in the same segment, which means those two numbers will satisfy that condition. This completes the proof.",AA,"Pass, Pass, Pass","A, A, A","A, A, A",None,None,"{

mem_cmcq2qhko001x0vpzbsfa02kc,2025-07-05 11:36:08.885,"There is an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with side legnth $1$. Points $D$ and $E$ are choses on its side $BC$ so that $BD=DE=EC=1/3$, and points $F$ is chose on its side $AC$ so that $AF=1/3$. What is the sum of $\angle ADF$ and $\angle AEF$?",probID_Angles_Sum_Classic,"**Answer**: $30^{\circ}$.

There are many ways to prove this, here is one of them:

1. Since $AF = BD$ in an equilateral triangle $ABC$, we must have $DF || AB$. Therefore $\angle ADF = \angle BAD$.

2. Note that $EC = 1/3$, and $FC = AC - AF = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3$, and $\angle ECF = 60^{\circ}$. This implies that $\triangle FEC$ is a right-angled triangle with the $\angle FEC$ being the right one. 

3. Let $AH$ be the altitude of the triangle $ABC$. Then $AH || FE$, which implies that $\angle AEF = \angle HAE$.

4. Finally, putting the steps 1 and 3 together, gives us that 

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","Claim 1: $ADE$ is an isosceles triangle.
Proof of claim 1: by symmetry, since $ABC$ is equilateral and the distances $BD$ and $EC$ are the same (1/3). 

Claim 2: $\angle DAE$ is 20 degrees. 
Proof of claim 2: 
Note that since $ABC$ is equilateral, $\angle CAB$ is 60 degrees. By symmetry, we can easily see the two other angles that with $\angle DAE$ make up $\angle CAB$ are each 20 degrees themself, (as they are the internal angle of a 1/3 splitting of the triangle) and so $\angle DAE$ is 20 degrees.

Claim 3: $\angle EDA$ and $\angle AED$ sum to 160 degrees. 
Proof of claim 3: $\angle EDA$ and $\angle AED$ are the internal angles of a triangle along with $\angle DAE$. Since $\angle DAE$ is 20 degreesm that leaves them as summing to 180-20=160.

Claim 4:
Each of $\angle EDA$ and $\angle AED$ are 80 degrees.
Proof of claim 4: They are equal by claim 1, since they are the two correspondingly equal angles of an isosceles triangle. Since they sum to 160, each must be 80 therefore.

Claim 5:
DFC is an equilateral triangle. 
Proof of claim 5: DFC is clearly similar to ABC, since it has two sides aligned with BC and AC, but each shrunk from 1 to 2/3 (the same scaling).

Claim 6:
$\angle CDF$ is 60 degrees.
Proof of claim 6: It is an internal angle of an equilateral triangle.

Claim 7:
$\angle ADF$ is 20 degrees.
Proof of claim 7: it summed with $\angle CDF$ is 80 degrees, and claim 6 means that it is 80-60-20. 

Claim 8:
$\angle FED$ is 90 degrees.
Proof:
A line from a an equilateral triangle that bisects its opposite side necessarily perpendicularly bisects.

Claim 9:
$\angle AEF$ is 10 degrees.
Proof:
$\angle AEF + \angle AED = \angle FED$, so $\angle AEF = \angle FED - \angle AED$ which by the prior claims is 90-80=10.

for any $a, b$. So, let's consider the inverses of the given 101 numbers, which will all belong to the interval $[1/2, 1]$, and suppose they are $1/2 \leq x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_{101} \leq 1$. Then, all we need to show that there must be two numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that

\[ \frac{1}{|x_i - x_j|} \geq 200 \]

which is equivalent to 

\[ |x_i - x_j| \leq 1/200 \]

Suppose this is not true, i.e no such $i$ and $j$ exist. But then we must have that $x_{i+1} - x_i > 1/200$ for every $i=1,2,...,100$. Summing these up all over all of the $i = 1,2,...,100$ we will then have that

1. Thus, the expression: 
ab/a-b (dropping the absolute value because we are assuming a>b, which means a-b is positive)
 simplifies to 1/ ((1/a) - (1/b)). 
Let this expression be denoted as 1/k for now, where k = (1/a) - (1/b).

2. It is given in the question that there are 101 numbers that lie in the range [1,2], thus their reciprocals lie in the range [1/2,1]. 

3. By pigeonhole principle we know that at least two of these reciprocals differ by less than (1/2)*(1/100) = 1/200. We are dividing the range by 100 because since there are 101 numbers, at least two will lie in the same interval and will thus differ by less than 200.

mem_cmcq2xo5o016q0wr70xdmg1ig,2025-07-05 11:42:54.168,"There is an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with side legnth $1$. Points $D$ and $E$ are choses on its side $BC$ so that $BD=DE=EC=1/3$, and points $F$ is chose on its side $AC$ so that $AF=1/3$. What is the sum of $\angle ADF$ and $\angle AEF$?",probID_Angles_Sum_Classic,"**Answer**: $30^{\circ}$.

There are many ways to prove this, here is one of them:

1. Since $AF = BD$ in an equilateral triangle $ABC$, we must have $DF || AB$. Therefore $\angle ADF = \angle BAD$.

2. Note that $EC = 1/3$, and $FC = AC - AF = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3$, and $\angle ECF = 60^{\circ}$. This implies that $\triangle FEC$ is a right-angled triangle with the $\angle FEC$ being the right one. 

3. Let $AH$ be the altitude of the triangle $ABC$. Then $AH || FE$, which implies that $\angle AEF = \angle HAE$.

4. Finally, putting the steps 1 and 3 together, gives us that 

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","Firstly let's prove FD is parallel to AB. Using the converse of Thales’ Theorem
(the theorem about proportional segments) If a line cuts the sides of an angle and the segments it creates are proportional to given segments, then the line is parallel to the base line. Since FD cuts BC in a 1;3 ratio where BD/BC=1/3. Therefore, FD is parallel to AB.
AB intersects both FD and AB, which are both parellel, which means angle ADF will be equal to angle BAD. ( this is due to the fact that if a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then it creates pairs of equal alternate exterior angles.) Lets label angle BAD as n.
Above we proved that FD and AB are parallel, this also leads to the fact that if AB has a length of 1 then FD has a length of 2/3. Triangle FDC is also equilateral and all side lengths are equal to 2/3. 
We can prove that FE is perpendicular to BC. FE intersects BC at point E, and this point divides the segment DC into equal lengths. A median in an equilateral triangle is also its height. Therefore FE is perpendicular to BC.
Let AH represent the height of triangle ABC where AH intersects BC at point H.  FE is parallel to AH because  two lines are both perpendicular to the same line, so they must be parallel to each other. Since a traversal line creates angle AEF, angle HAE will be equal to AEF. Lets label HAE as m. 
Now let's consider triangle DAE. Since AH divides DE into equal lengths, DAE is an isosceles triangle which means angle DAH= angle HAE=m. Also AD=AE
Triangles ABD and AEC are equal ( AB=AC, BD=EC=1/3, AD=AE) which means angle  BAD=EAC=n.

This is equivalent to taking the reciprocal values of both sides and reversing the sign, $\frac{|a-b|}{ab} \le \frac1{200}$ which is then equivalent to $|\frac1b-\frac1a| \le \frac1{200}$. Since a and b are from [1,2], we know that $\frac1a$ and $\frac1b$ are from $[\frac12,1]$. We can then divide the interval $[\frac12,1]$ into 100 equal intervals of length $\frac1{200}$ of the form $[\frac12+\frac{k}{200}, \frac12+\frac{k+1}{200} ]$ for k from 0 to 99. Then, by the pigeonhole principle, we know that the reciprocal values of some two of the 101 numbers, called a and b, must lie in the same interval of length $\frac1{200}$ which means that their distance is less than or equal to $\frac1{200}$. This then means that $|\frac1b-\frac1a| \le \frac1{200}$ which is equivalent to $\frac{ab}{|a-b|} \ge 200$ which was the original statement to be proven.

What is the sum of $\angle ADF$ and $\angle AEF$?",probID_Angles_Sum_Classic,"**Answer**: $30^{\circ}$.

There are many ways to prove this, here is one of them:

1. Since $AF = BD$ in an equilateral triangle $ABC$, we must have $DF || AB$. Therefore $\angle ADF = \angle BAD$.

2. Note that $EC = 1/3$, and $FC = AC - AF = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3$, and $\angle ECF = 60^{\circ}$. This implies that $\triangle FEC$ is a right-angled triangle with the $\angle FEC$ being the right one. 

3. Let $AH$ be the altitude of the triangle $ABC$. Then $AH || FE$, which implies that $\angle AEF = \angle HAE$.

4. Finally, putting the steps 1 and 3 together, gives us that 

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","It's easy to see that triangles ABC and FDC are similar, since they share the angle C, and two sides are proportional (FC to AC, and DC to BC), thus FDC is also equilateral. Now we can see that FE is median (since it divides DC in two equal parts), and height(altitude) (from properties of equilateral triangle). And thus it is perpendicular to DC and BC (since BC is parallel to DC). And since FDC is equilateral all angels are 60deg. So ang(CDF) is 60deg. Now lets find ang(EDA). We can draw a new point M in the middle of BC. And draw a line AM (AM is median and height(and altitude). We get a right triangle ADM (ang(M) = 90deg). We know the area of ABC (it's sqrt(3) * a^2 / 4, so sqrt(3) / 4), so we can find $AM = area * 2 / BC = sqrt(3) / 2$, and we can find $DM = 1/2 * DE= BC/6 = 1/6$. So the green angle from the drawing is ang(MDA) - ang(CDF), and the blue angle is $ang(DEF) - ang(DEA) = ang(DEF) - ang(MDA)$, and thus the sum is $ang(MDA) - ang(CDF) +ang(DEF) - ang(MDA) = -ang(CDF) + ang(DEF) = 90-60 = 30deg$",BE,"Pass, Pass, Pass","B, E, B","E, E, F",None / None that won't hint towards a correct solution,"1.

Prove that among them there is pair $(a,b)$ such that $\frac{ab}{|a-b|} \geq 200$.",probID_Inequality_for_Some_Pair,"The key idea is that \[ \frac{ab}{|a-b|} = \frac{1}{|1/a - 1/b|} \] 

for any $a, b$. So, let's consider the inverses of the given 101 numbers, which will all belong to the interval $[1/2, 1]$, and suppose they are $1/2 \leq x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_{101} \leq 1$. Then, all we need to show that there must be two numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that

\[ \frac{1}{|x_i - x_j|} \geq 200 \]

which is equivalent to 

\[ |x_i - x_j| \leq 1/200 \]

Suppose this is not true, i.e no such $i$ and $j$ exist. But then we must have that $x_{i+1} - x_i > 1/200$ for every $i=1,2,...,100$. Summing these up all over all of the $i = 1,2,...,100$ we will then have that 

\[ x_{101} - x_1  = (x_2 - x_1) + (x_3 - x_2) + ... + (x_{101} - x_{100}) > 100 \cdot 1/200 = 1/2\]

Which is impossible since $x_{101}, x_1$ belong to $[1/2, 1]$, i.e. distance between them is at most $1/2$. This contradiction finishes the proof.","Let us assume the contrary, i.e. there exist $101$ different real numbers $1\leq x_1 < x_2 < \cdots < x_{101}\leq 2$ such that $\frac{x_i x_j}{|x_i - x_j|} < 200$ for all $i$ and $j$.

**Step 1.** Consider the numbers $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$. We have that $x_{i+1} > x_i$ by definition, so $|x_{i+1} - x_i| = x_{i+1} - x_i$. Therefore, we have that
\[\frac{x_ix_{i+1}}{|x_i-x_{i+1}|} = \frac{x_i x_{i+1}}{x_{i+1} - x_i}.\]
Now, if we assume that these expressions are all strictly less than $200$, then we get that
\[\sum\limits_{i=1}^{100} \frac{x_i x_{i+1}}{x_{i+1} - x_i} < 100 \cdot 200.\]

**Step 2.** However, by Titu's inequality, we get that:
\[\sum\limits_{i=1}^{100} \frac{x_ix_{i+1}}{x_{i+1} - x_i} \geq \frac{(\sum\limits_{i=1}^{100} \sqrt{x_i x_j})^2}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i+1} - x_i)} = \frac{1}{x_{101} - x_1}\cdot \left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^{100} \sqrt{x_i x_{i+1}}\right)^2\]
Here $x_{101} - x_1 \leq 2 - 1 = 1$, and finally,

What is the sum of $\angle ADF$ and $\angle AEF$?",probID_Angles_Sum_Classic,"**Answer**: $30^{\circ}$.

There are many ways to prove this, here is one of them:

1. Since $AF = BD$ in an equilateral triangle $ABC$, we must have $DF || AB$. Therefore $\angle ADF = \angle BAD$.

2. Note that $EC = 1/3$, and $FC = AC - AF = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3$, and $\angle ECF = 60^{\circ}$. This implies that $\triangle FEC$ is a right-angled triangle with the $\angle FEC$ being the right one. 

3. Let $AH$ be the altitude of the triangle $ABC$. Then $AH || FE$, which implies that $\angle AEF = \angle HAE$.

4. Finally, putting the steps 1 and 3 together, gives us that 

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","let's denote with M the midpoint segment BC. we know that CF/CA=(2/3)/1=2/3, and CE/CM=(1/3)/(1/2)=2/3, so CF/CM=CE/CM, and therefore EF is parallel to AM. Since ABC is an equilateral triangle, $AM\perp BC$, and since AM and EF are parallel, $EF\perp BC$.
Let's introduce point G on segment AB, such that AG=1/3.
Now we can notice that ∠ADF = ∠AEG because of symmetry, since AF = AG =1/3, 
Therefore the sum we’re looking for
∠ADF + ∠AEF = ∠AEG + ∠AEF = ∠FEG.
Since $EF\perp BC$, ∠FEB=90°.

Since BG∕BA = 2∕3 and BE∕BC = 2∕3, GE is parallel to AC, so ∠BEG=BCA=60°.

Now we are looking for ∠FEB.
∠FEG = ∠FEB-∠BEG= 90° – 60° = 30°

2. And we know that $a \times b$, $a \times c$ and $b \times c$ are, in some order, $2$, $3$ and $6$. Thus,
\[ (a \times b) + (a \times c) + (b \times c) = 2 + 3 + 6 = 11 \]

Therefore, if we write \[ a + b + c + a + b + c - ((a \times b) + (a \times c) + (b \times c)) \] we will always get $6 + 6 - 11 = 1$.","1. We should find expressions with $a,b$ and $c$ such that no matter in which order we substitute numbers $1,2$ and $3$ instead of $a,b$ and $c$ 

2. Therefore each part of the expression should be symmetric for $a,b,c$.

3. let's count, for example, a sum of those 3 numbers $a+b+c=6$ while all of them are different, and there must be hence $1,2,3$  

4. let us count, for example, a sum of paired multiplication of those $3$ numbers $ab+bc+ca$ while all of them are different, and there must be hence $3$ different terms, which is the number of different results for such paired multiplication $1*2=2$,$3*2=6$,$3*1=6$. 
Therefore, $ab+bc+ca=11$ 

5. Let's count $a+b+c+a+b+c-ab+bc+ca=6+6-11=1$

Prove that among them there is pair $(a,b)$ such that $\frac{ab}{|a-b|} \geq 200$.",probID_Inequality_for_Some_Pair,"The key idea is that \[ \frac{ab}{|a-b|} = \frac{1}{|1/a - 1/b|} \] 

for any $a, b$. So, let's consider the inverses of the given 101 numbers, which will all belong to the interval $[1/2, 1]$, and suppose they are $1/2 \leq x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_{101} \leq 1$. Then, all we need to show that there must be two numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that

\[ \frac{1}{|x_i - x_j|} \geq 200 \]

which is equivalent to 

\[ |x_i - x_j| \leq 1/200 \]

Suppose this is not true, i.e no such $i$ and $j$ exist. But then we must have that $x_{i+1} - x_i > 1/200$ for every $i=1,2,...,100$. Summing these up all over all of the $i = 1,2,...,100$ we will then have that 

\[ x_{101} - x_1  = (x_2 - x_1) + (x_3 - x_2) + ... + (x_{101} - x_{100}) > 100 \cdot 1/200 = 1/2\]

Which is impossible since $x_{101}, x_1$ belong to $[1/2, 1]$, i.e. distance between them is at most $1/2$. This contradiction finishes the proof.","Let's analyze the problem carefully.

## Problem Restatement

You have 101 distinct real numbers chosen from the interval $$$$. You want to prove that there exists a pair $$(a,b)$$ among these numbers such that

$$
\frac{ab}{|a-b|} \geq 200.
$$

## Intuition and Approach

- Since all numbers lie in $$$$, the product $$ab$$ is at least $$1 \cdot 1 = 1$$ and at most $$2 \cdot 2 = 4$$.
- The expression $$\frac{ab}{|a-b|}$$ becomes large when $$|a-b|$$ is very small.
- With 101 distinct numbers in an interval of length 1, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least two numbers very close to each other.
- The goal is to show that the minimal distance between any two numbers is so small that $$\frac{ab}{|a-b|}$$ is at least 200 for some pair.

## Step 1: Use the Pigeonhole Principle to Bound the Minimum Gap

We have 101 distinct numbers $$x_1  200.
$$

This satisfies the inequality.

## Conclusion

Since among 101 points in $$$$, at least 51 lie in either $$[1,1.5]$$ or $$(1.5,2]$$, and in the latter case the minimal gap implies the desired inequality, **there exists a pair $$(a,b)$$ such that**

$$
\frac{ab}{|a-b|} \geq 200.
$$

# **Final Summary**

- Split $$$$ into two intervals of length 0.5.
- One interval contains at least 51 points.
- Minimal gap in that interval is at most $$0.01$$.
- If the points are in $$(1.5,2]$$, then $$ab \geq 2.25$$, so

$$
\frac{ab}{|a-b|} \geq \frac{2.25}{0.01} = 225 > 200.
$$

- Hence, such a pair $$(a,b)$$ always exists.

What is the sum of $\angle ADF$ and $\angle AEF$?",probID_Angles_Sum_Classic,"**Answer**: $30^{\circ}$.

There are many ways to prove this, here is one of them:

1. Since $AF = BD$ in an equilateral triangle $ABC$, we must have $DF || AB$. Therefore $\angle ADF = \angle BAD$.

2. Note that $EC = 1/3$, and $FC = AC - AF = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3$, and $\angle ECF = 60^{\circ}$. This implies that $\triangle FEC$ is a right-angled triangle with the $\angle FEC$ being the right one. 

3. Let $AH$ be the altitude of the triangle $ABC$. Then $AH || FE$, which implies that $\angle AEF = \angle HAE$.

4. Finally, putting the steps 1 and 3 together, gives us that 

\[ \angle ADF +  \angle AEF = \angle BAD + \angle HAE = \angle BAH \]

and $\angle BAH = 30^{\circ}$ because $AH$ is an angle bisector, altitude and a median of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Hence the answer.","let's denote with M the midpoint segment BC. we know that CF/CA=(2/3)/1=2/3, and CE/CM=(1/3)/(1/2)=2/3, so CF/CM=CE/CM, and therefore EF is parallel to AM. Since ABC is an equilateral triangle, $AM\perp BC$, and since AM and EF are parallel, $EF\perp BC$.
Let's introduce point G on segment AB, such that AG=1/3.
Now we can notice that ∠ADF = ∠AEG because of symmetry, since AF = AG =1/3, 
Therefore the sum we’re looking for
∠ADF + ∠AEF = ∠AEG + ∠AEF = ∠FEG.
Since $EF\perp BC$, ∠FEB=90°.

Since BG∕BA = 2∕3 and BE∕BC = 2∕3, GE is parallel to AC, so ∠BEG=BCA=60°.

Now we are looking for ∠FEB.
