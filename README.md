# Automation Scripts

This repository contains a list of automation scripts that have been useful to me (and will still be) and may also help others :)

## Scripts
1. **`auto_pageant_loader`**: Automatically loads your RSA key into Pageant on Windows (can be set up to run automatically during shell startup for the Python script).

## Dependencies
- **`pyautogui`**: Automates GUI actions.
- **`python-dotenv`**: Loads environment variables from the `.env` file.
